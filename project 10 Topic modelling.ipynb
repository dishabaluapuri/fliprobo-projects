       " '\\nSeveral organisations have announced that they will join Monday’s State bandh in Belagavi and Vijayapura districts. This will be as effective as it was during the lockdown, Karnataka Rakshana Vedike district unit president Deepak Gudanatti told journalists in Belagavi on Sunday. He announced that several organisations were supporting the bandh on Monday. “Kannada organisations, Dalit organisations, farmers organisations and youth organisations are supporting the bandh,” he added. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha leader Jayashree Gurannanavar said that the three national bills and the land reforms amendment bill of the State had the potential to destroy millions of farmers. “They can reduce land-owning farmers to landless workers, bonded labour and indebted workers whose children and grandchildren would have to work for decades to repay loans,” she said. Choonappa Pujari and others were present. Karnataka Rajya Raitha Sangha members in Vijayapura said that they would participate in the bandh in protest against the farm bills. Belagavi Superintendent of Police Lakshman Nimbaragi gave a stern warning to protesters urging them not to damage public property in the name of the bandh. In a video message released here on Sunday, he said that no law and order disturbance would be allowed on Monday .“Farmers and others who are participating in the bandh should not block roads nor cause damage to property. If they do, they will be seriously dealt with as per law,” he said.“They should observe social distancing and other COVID-19 safety protocol. If they violate these, action will be taken against them under the Disaster Management Act. Action will also be taken against those who force merchants to close shops,” he said. Protesters should peacefully assemble at Tahsildar offices, submit memorandum copies and disperse, the Superintendent of Police said. He warned that the district had 4,000 CCTV cameras installed in strategic locations and important points in the district. “We will also use drones. Their footage will be studied for signs of disturbance,” he said. Rajya Sabha member and BJP Krishi Morcha leader Eeranna Kadadi said that the bandh was organised by vested interests and not genuine farmers groups. “The Congress is organising the protests with political motives. I urge the farmers not to fall into the trap laid by the Congress,” he added. He said that farm land and farm produce would fetch better prices if the farm Acts were implemented. NWKRTC officers said that buses would operated as usual across North Karnataka. \\n',\n",

       " \"\\nJaswant Singh was guided by a view of “India’s destiny”, External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar said on Sunday, paying a tribute to the former External Affairs Minister. “His long view of events was borne from his erudition and understanding of political complexities. If you were to ask, which of my predecessors had influenced me most, that would be Jaswant Singh,” Dr. Jaishankar told The Hindu, speaking of Mr. Singh’s tenure from 1998-2002, an extremely eventful period in Indian foreign policy, whose imprint endures.  \\n\\nAlso Read\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJaswant Singh: End of a long journey for the Army man-turned-parliamentarian\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Within the first three months of his tenure, Mr. Singh’s most important task was cut out at Pokhran, after India’s nuclear tests in May 1998 — that of restoring India’s ties with the world, particularly the U.S. and Japan who reacted very strongly to the Vajpayee government’s decision.Mr. Jaishankar, who was India’s Deputy Chief Mission in Tokyo at the time, recalls how Mr. Singh led a difficult mission to Japan in 1999, after the Hashimoto government had frozen all ties for a period of three years, and, along with the U.S., announced a slew of economic sanctions. “Mr. Singh was directly responsible for the return to normalcy [in ties] starting from his 1999 visit,” recalled Mr. Jaishankar. He added, “In particular, he saw that the key to global acceptance of India’s nuclear status was to gain the U.S.'s acceptance, which he pursued through personal diplomacy.” Mr. Singh, formerly a Major in the Indian Army belonging to the Central India Horses cavalry regiment, built strong friendships by striking a personal chord. His former private secretary in the Finance Ministry, V. Srinivas recalls that his motto was “trust the man, not the paper”. Reactions to Jaswant Singh's death | Left a strong mark as a soldier and parliamentarian, says PM ModiWhen U.S. President Bill Clinton visited India in 2000, Mr. Singh arranged a visit to his home State of Rajasthan, where Mr. Clinton saw tigers, and played Holi with villagers. With his counterpart in the U.S. (General) Colin Powell, Mr. Singh shared the greeting, “from one soldier to another”.In his talks with U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott, who was also a good friend, Mr. Singh quite bluntly said the U.S. style of “checklist diplomacy”, based on ticking off a list of specific agreements, clashed terribly with the Indian style of building a mutual understanding, where specifics could be discussed later.He was candid enough to admit later, that the clash accounted for many disagreements over the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, and other Indo-U.S. issues as well. Another relationship he worked to restore post-Pokhran was with Gulf countries, and particularly Saudi Arabia, through a visit in 2001, when Prince Saud presented him with four Arabian horses. The horses were kept with the President’s Bodyguard (PBG) at Rashtrapati Bhawan, and Mr. Singh was often seen by early morning walkers, riding them. He also became the first Indian Foreign Minister to visit both Israel and Palestine during his tenure. Also Read | Jaswant Singh’s demise leaves a void: Sonia GandhiEven in his most difficult task, that of dealing with Pakistan despite the onslaught of some of the worst terror attacks at the time, the Kargil war, and the military mobilisation during Operation Parakram, Mr. Singh managed to strike a rapport with each of his interlocuters including President Pervez Musharraf.“He was not a romantic or nostalgic about ties with Pakistan, but his view was that if India wanted to grow in the world, it would have to deal with its neighbour, and keep trying,” explained retired diplomat TCA Raghavan, one of his closest aides, and now now Director of the Indian Council of World Affairs (ICWA). In later years, when Mr. Singh was an opposition leader, and Mr. Raghavan the DCM in Islamabad, Mr. Singh decided to travel across the desert from his native Barmer to the Hinglaj Mata temple in Balochistan, along with a hundred Hindu pilgrims. Although the visit was inadvisable, given the rigours of the journey and the unpredictability of ties with Pakistan, Mr. Singh insisted on going. Much to everyone’s surprise, President Musharraf had ordered an entire tent city to be set up in the desert to welcome the travellers from India, and all traditional hospitality provided. Each day in office ended only after Mr. Singh had meticulously recorded his impressions in a diary. Writing about his most difficult assignment of travelling to Kandahar on December 31, 1999, with three terrorists including Masood Azhar onboard, who were then exchanged for the release of 175 Indian captives aboard flight IC-814, Mr. Singh described a young mother who was a hostage who grabbed his neck and berated him for having “betrayed” them during the week-long hijacking ordeal.“There was so much criticism of his actions, but he took it on the chin, and accepted the blame on behalf of the government,” Mr. Raghavan said.In his memoirs, Mr. Singh said “navigating the decidedly stormy diplomatic seas,” was his ‘Call to Honour’.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nAppealing to farmers’ organisations to drop the bandh call given on Monday, Chief Minister B.S. Yeddyurappa on Sunday urged the farmers’ leaders not to cause “unnecessary confusion” over amendments to farm Acts. “Farmers’ leaders should understand the objectives of the changes brought to the Acts and not create unnecessary confusion,” the Chief Minister told presspersons here on Sunday. “I spoke to the farmers the day before yesterday. Our government’s stand and Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision is in favour of farmers’ welfare. The decision has been made to double the income of farmers and their demand of several years has been been met,” he added. He claimed that “90 out of 100 farmers had welcomed it.”Meanwhile, Revenue Minister R. Ashok said, “From the government’s perspective there is no bandh at all. Arrangements have been made to allow normal functioning of government offices, hospitals, and businesses, while taxi and bus services will be normal. People need not fear or be anxious.” He also warned of strict police action against those indulging in violence or trying to disrupt life.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nThe Indigenous Nationalist Party of Tripura (INPT) is expected to forge an alliance with a new socio-political platform floated by royal scion Pradyot Kishore Debbarman in the ensuing elections to the Tripura Tribal Areas Autonomous District Council (TTAADC).Several leaders of the INPT, a traditional ally of the Congress, said they would partner with a party which has more rsonance among the indigenous society. Mr. Debbarman, son of State’s last King Maharaja Kirit Bikram Kishore Manikya, recently floated the TIPRA meaning indigenous or native people. Mr. Debbarman last year resigned as president of the State Congress and from the party amid differences with the central leadership over some critical issues concerning the tribal population.Sources said the TIPRA would involve in electioneering of the TTAADC though it has not yet made its political intention public. Some followers of the IPFT, a coalition partner of the BJP and other indigenous groups, have joined it.If the INPT joins hands with the TIPRA, the Congress will virtually be left with no partner but contest the TTAADC elections alone.

       " '\\nInstead of the massive confluence of faith and culture, Oachira Parabrahma Temple saw a miniscule gathering on Sunday as the annual Kettukazhcha was held with rituals only.Usually the renowned car festival takes place on a large scale, drawing thousands of devotees and visitors from all parts. While nearly 200 cars representing various ‘karas’ (areas) in Karunagapally, Karthikapally and Mavelikkara taluks had participated in the festival last year, this time there was only a single pair of bulls. Oachira Kettukazhcha, a carnival that parades the biggest bull effigies in Asia, is held on Irupathettam Onam to celebrate the harvest festival. Considering the current situation, the temple committee had decided to observe the festival in symbolic manner, following just the basic rituals and ceremonies. All the celebrations and related events were called off and nobody was given permission to bring cars to temple this year. Every year, preparations for the festival begins much in advance and the huge effigies are always built by experts. All the participating karas from all three taluks will be in a celebratory mood for a month and Kettukazhcha is the culmination of all festivities. The cars come in all sizes and while some can be very small, most of them stand at a height of 30 feet and above. Symbols of Lord Shiva’s vehicle Nandi, each car consists of two bulls in red and white adorned with pieces of golden kudamani (ornated umbrellas) and a caparison. The festival is also a celebration of the agrarian culture, as bulls are an integral part of farming. It is also ‘Kannukali Onam’ (Onam for cattle) in some parts. Vishwaprajapathi Kalabhairavan, one of the cars paraded in the jam-packed padanilam (rally ground) last year, was 65 feet tall. It was accompanied by several others in varying heights making the pageant an impressive spectacle. This year, it was the lone car of the temple committee that stood at the nearly deserted padanilam in the evening and all the rituals came to an end with deeparadhana (prayer with lights) and ezhunnallathu (procession). “We were approached by several karas but we couldn’t permit any of them. The temple remained closed for the public during the last six months, but devotees will be allowed entry after the festival from Monday onwards,” said temple committee president Sreedharan Pillai. \\n',\n",

The farmers have also been encouraged to raise nursery and undertake cultivation through System of Rice Intensification, as it gives higher yield,” he said. All inputs, including seeds and fertilizers, are available at sufficient quantities at the agriculture extension centres, he added. M.

       " '\\n As COVID-19 cases surge, the health system, including the private sector, is feeling the pressure of increased demand for hospital admissions and critical-care facilities.Three weeks ago, people who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 had the freedom to opt for a private hospital of his/her choice, whether he was asymptomatic or had mild symptoms. However, it is no longer easy to walk in to a private hospital seeking admission, because beds are getting filled up. Home care advised“Availability of beds is indeed becoming a problem now that more people are testing positive day by day. We are also now counselling our asymptomatic patients to opt for home care so that the hospital beds can be saved for those patients with comorbidities or respiratory issues. We have a home-care package wherein patients are tele-counselled and followed up regularly so that they have nothing to fear,” says A. Rajalakshmi, senior consultant in Infectious Diseases and Infection Control, KIMS.Thiruvananthapuram has the advantages of a well-equipped hospital network, both private and public, as well as a well-streamlined district health administration. Despite recording around 1,000 cases a day, the district is holding up well, with only 1.5% of the cases reaching ICUs. With the exception of Kozhikode and Ernakulam, other districts would just fold up if cases surged further and the State crossed the 10,000 cases a day mark, it is feared. Public health experts point out that more attention should be on the 60% of asymptomatic patients and those with mild symptoms who are now pushed to either home care or COVID-19 first or second line treatment centres to prevent them from going into complications.“Earlier, all positive patients were immediately hospitalised. Now, doctors are trying to send as many as possible to home care or first-line treatment centres (FLTC). But this is a process which needs to be done with much more care and diligence or else there could be unnecessary deaths,” cautions a senior doctor.Category C patients with serious symptoms alone are now referred to medical college hospitals. All asymptomatics and those with mild symptoms are assigned to home care or FLTCs, while Category B (patients with co-morbidities) are send to second- line treatment centres. Inadequate facilitiesFLTCs are the weak link in the system right now because the facilities in most are hardly adequate.“Now that beds at both public and private sector hospitals are getting dear, people are opting for home care just to avoid FLTCs and that could lead to unforeseen problems,” he said. “The government should come out with district-wise lists of ICUs and beds available in hospitals and FLTCs. There should also be some agency or call centre at district-level for real-time monitoring of available beds and to coordinate its distribution. Or else, a COVID-19 patient who requires medical attention will end up going from hospital to hospital in the eleventh hour,” points out A.V. Jayakrishnan, chairman, IMA Hospital Board of India.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nMass testing, screening and isolation of positive patients, along with compliance to ‘social vaccine’ of masks, personal hygiene and social distancing, is the only way forward to contain the raging COVID-19 pandemic, insist top scientists.“This much is certain; we are nowhere close to the end of the pandemic, We do not know when we are going to cross the peak, There are theoretical models but in the absence of reliable data, we cannot bank on them. Peak or plateau will come only when we do something about it,” says CSIR- CCMB Director Rakesh Mishra.Indians are “lucky” because the virus has spared many lives and most are asymptomatic, needing no hospitalisation. Yet, “if we allow things to drift as is happening now, the situation could get worse and what we do not want to happen is to get the hospitals crowded beyond capacity putting the healthcare system under more pressure,” he points out, in an exclusive interview. We should consider ourselves “extremely lucky” if we get the vaccine by the year-end or early next year. But, our preparation should be to deal with the virus without vaccine as there is no drug available. It could also take up to two years for the entire population to be covered, he explains.“Any vaccine is not a sure shot. Most candidates are early experiments that are done in-vitro and on animals. When it reaches the people. it is a different story. Efficacy and robustness depend on how many people can get protection from infection irrespective of different age groups and health conditions. Unlike a drug that can go and hit the target, a vaccine needs to work through the immune system of the body and comes with a different level of complexity,” says the director.“Never before so much money and effort has been put into making a vaccine against one infectious agent at a time. Regulatory authorities could also facilitate by relaxing rules due to the pandemic; for example, by combining two stages (Phase 1 and 2) to save time if they find it to be safe. But, how good a vaccine works, only time will tell. The fastest vaccine, so far, has come in four years and, therefore, talking about a few months is a bit ambitious. However, we can’t rule it out and there is no harm in giving our luck a chance,” he says. Dr. Mishra says the major issue in knowing about a vaccine is that “you just wait after vaccination to see that a person does not get infected for a long time. It is very difficult to check for efficacy and robustness in the population in few months and requires long term monitoring. A short cut could expose the volunteers to active infection; it is unethical as there is no drug to give if the person does get infected.”The CCMB director is sure we will eventually get back to some kind of “normalcy or new normalcy” in a few months with “some kind of herd immunity and some drugs helping the balance”. However, it has become imperative to strengthen public healthcare for a large population. “It is clear we cannot have private medicare at a cost within the reach of 10% population, ignoring the weaker sections. No one is safe unless the entire population is taken care of as has been evident in last few months,” he adds.\\n',\n",

There is a set procedure for it and it usually takes one-and-a-half months to complete it,” he said.The Instrument Landing System guides pilots land aircraft even in case of minimum visibility. It consists of a localiser, glide path and distance measuring equipment. ILS is a standard International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) precision landing aid which is used to provide accurate descent guidance signals to aircraft for landing on the runway under normal or adverse weather conditions.In Hubballi, the installation of ILS began during January and it has now been completed successfully. Although night landing facility is available in Hubballi, ILS was missing resulting in flight delays during inclement weather conditions. Airport sources said that ILS would help in avoiding accidents while landing. In March 2015, a SpiceJet aircraft carrying 75 passengers and crew had skidded off the runway in Hubballi.

From boat rides through its canals to walking tracks and village life to cultural experience, the local body is now ready with a host of tourism products and services that are cent percent locally owned.As many as 118 RT units have been established in the panchayat, which seeks to establish a destination code for the local community and the visitors, and achieve self-sufficiency through tourism. Training has been imparted to 617 persons in different tourism-related activities, besides initiating waste management projects in association with the local body and the Haritha Keralam Mission.The project envisaged a structured development of village’s interiors to maintain a balance between the guests and the local community, said K.

       " '\\nThoothukudi district police has busted a gang that was trying to sell six containers of a “mystery substance” claiming it to be iridium here on Sunday. Apart from arresting four persons, the police also seized a SUV and two sharp weapons and a compact disc on iridium. “We need to ascertain what the substance is by sending it to a laboratory,” Superintendent of Police, S. Jayakumar, said. Talking to reporters, he said that the police received a tip-off from one S. Thangam (55) of Muthiahpuram about a gang that had sought his help to sell iridium, worth several crores of rupees. Based on the alert, a special police team, led by Deputy Superintendent of Police (Thoothukudi Rural), Ponnarasu, and SIPCOT police station Inspector of Police, Muthusubramanian, tracked down the suspects. The police identified them as S. Vaithiyalingam (65) of Karaikudi and K. Muthuramalingam (45) of Mudukulathor and P. Mariyadhas (40) and M. Murugan (47), both from Thoothukudi. During enquiry, they said that they had got the iridium from a person in Pattukottai.  They claimed that the iridium had been stolen from the Defence Research and Development Organisation in Mumbai. Mr. Jayakumar said that the worth of the substance can be ascertained only if the genuineness of the material was established. However, he appealed to the people, especially industrialists, to be wary of such gangs who had come up with ‘novel ideas’ of selling vastu-compliant objects like iridium, temple ‘kalasams’ and also sand boa claiming that these objects would bring good fortune. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nTCS iON, a strategic unit of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) has announced that its National Qualifier Test (NQT), usually conducted to recruit candidates for TCS, will now be open for several participating corporates for their fresher recruitment programmes.This standardized test will provide candidates with access to employment at multiple corporates, while helping the employers get an in-depth understanding of job seeker’s cognitive abilities.The NQT will be conducted every quarter and the score will be valid for two years. The first test, which will be available for free, will be held from October 24-26. Registrations are open until October 17. The company may not charge for next few tests as well.Candidates can take the test multiple times to improve their scores. More for registration can be available at https://learning.tcsionhub.in/hub/national-qualifier-test/Candidates can take the test from their homes and those who do not have access to the necessary infrastructure at home, can take the test from a TCS iON center.Young professionals with up to two years of experience, as well as students from any stream, currently enrolled in pre-final/ final year of undergraduate or postgraduate programs of Science & Commerce streams as well as form business schools, can apply for the test and gain an edge in a competitive job market. “The test acts as a single window for job opportunities across leading organizations in IT, BFSI, manufacturing, pharma, and FMCG sectors, including TCS,” the company said.The NQT will focus on general abilities covering verbal, numerical and reasoning abilities to arrive at the normalized NQT Score that can be presented to corporates as a demonstration of the candidate’s cognitive abilities while applying for job.Keeping in mind the huge demand from IT industry, the company is planning for a subject NQT which will be focused on programming.The company is planning to continuously improve the test blueprint to provide employers with a better understanding of candidates’ abilities. “With this unique National Qualifier Test, we are giving millions of young jobseekers an opportunity to work for India’s top corporates,” said Venguswamy Ramaswamy, Global Head, TCS iON in an interview.“This high-quality standardized test will provide subscribing corporates with a well-rounded evaluation of candidates’ abilities, and access to quality talent across the nation at speed and scale,” he said.Mr. Ramaswamy said through this process, the company is giving access to more than 60,000 jobs across all corporates through a single test now. “The NQT will be a single test that will open up a very large number of jobs in corporates.

       " '\\n Royal Challengers Bangalore would be looking to address their pace-bowling concerns when they face defending champions Mumbai Indians in the Indian Premier League here on Monday. RCB started on a winning note but then their star-studded collapsed against Kings XI Punjab, resulting in a humbling 97-run defeat. After scores of 14 and 1, Kohli is due for a big one and would be itching to spend more time in the middle. Opener Devdutt Padikkal, who started his IPL career with a classy half-century, did not do much against KXIP and will be aiming for consistency. Australian limited-overs captain Aaron Finch would be hoping to convert starts into match-winning performances while AB de Villers, who has looked in good touch, will be expected to provide the late fireworks again with the lower-order not inspiring a lot of hope.  It is still not clear whether RCB will have the services of South African all-rounder Chris Morris, who sat out of the first two games due to a side strain.  In the bowling department, Yuzvendra Chahal will be the key man with pacers, barring Navdeep Saini, leaking runs.  Dale Steyn and Umesh Yadav have proved expensive so far. The South African great is likely to retain his place in the playing eleven but the same can’t be said about Yadav, who could make way for Mohammad Siraj. England all-rounder Moeen Ali will be a welcome addition to the middle-order but with Josh Phillippe keeping wickets regularly, he can only replace Steyn. Mumbai Indians, who ticked all the boxes in their comfortable win against Kolkata Knight Riders, are unlikely to tinker with their team composition. The biggest positive is that skipper Rohit Sharma is back among the runs and looked in ominous touch against KKR, and so did Suryakumar Yadav. The only change that the team can make is bring in Ishan Kishan in place of the bulky Saurabh Tiwary. Apart from their batting prowess, Hardik Pandya and Kieron Pollard can jointly perform the role of an additional bowler, but MI coach Mahela Jayawardane has made it clear that they don’t want to take any risks with Hardik, who is playing after a long break following a back injury.  Another positive for the defending champions is that pace spearhead Jasprit Bumrah roared back to form after a rare failure against Chennai Super Kings. James Pattinson and Kiwi Trent Boult played their parts to perfection and they would be keen to continue in the same vein.  Teams (From): Royal Challengers Bangalore: Aaron Finch, Devdutt Padikkal, Parthiv Patel, Virat Kohli, AB de Villiers, Gurkeerat Singh, Shivam Dube, Chris Morris, Washington Sundar, Shahbaz Ahmed, Navdeep Saini, Dale Steyn, Yuzvendra Chahal, Adam Zampa, Isuru Udana, Moeen Ali, Josh Philippe, Pawan Negi, Pavan Deshpande, Mohammad Siraj, Umesh Yadav. Mumbai Indians: Rohit Sharma (C), Aditya Tare, Anmolpreet Singh, Anukul Roy, Chris Lynn, Dhawal Kulkarni, Digvijay Deshmukh, Hardik Pandya, Ishan Kishan, James Pattison, Jasprit Bumrah, Jayant Yadav, Kieron Pollard, Krunal Pandya, Mitchell McClenaghan, Mohsin Khan, Nathan Coulter-Nile, Prince Balwant Rai, Quinton De Kock, Rahul Chahar, Saurabh Tiwary, Sherfane Rutherford, Suryakumar Yadav, Trent Boult.Match starts at 7.30 PM IST. \\n',\n",

       " '\\nWith the announcement that students of classes X to XII have the option of going to school from October 1, the temporary vegetable and fruit market at the government-aided Sir Ramaswami Mudaliar Higher Secondary School on Chennai – Tiruvallur High (CTH) Road has shifted out. The Greater Chennai Corporation recently closed the temporary common market functioning at the school playground. With this move, traders have started operating from the regular markets. Many common markets were closed in March as part of lockdown measures to ensure social distancing in public places. Since early September, the Corporation has been easing various lockdown restrictions, which include allowing common markets that functioned from various residential colonies to function from their original places. “Many residents, especially those staying near the railway station were not aware of the closure of the temporary market in the playground,” says T. Gunaseelan, a long-time resident of Ambattur, adding that “Reopening of local markets with safety features is a welcome measure.” Although traders wanted the old market to be revamped before they were asked to occupy it, nothing much has been done, residents point out. It may be recalled that traders were far from happy with the amenities available at the temporary market on the playground that had no water, toilets and storage facilities. Many farmers from the outskirts also skipped the market for the past few weeks. The evening showers made the market unwelcoming even for customers. Poor patronage due to these factors also contributed to the sudden closure of the temporary market by the civic body, according to traders. \\n',\n",

In a press release, the Tea Board- Coonoor said that the deviations by the factories also included defaulting online payments to farmers, non-adherence to licensed production limits, non-removal of iron filings, failure to declare monthly tea waste produced, non-payment of green leaf price as per the price-sharing formula to farmers as well as for accumulating above-permissible levels of tea waste at the factories. The Tea Board said that a total of 119 tea factories were inspected in September in the Southern Zone and that the 109 factories which were found to have the “deviations” have been given time to reply and offer their explanations as to why they were not following established rules governing the various aspects of green tea production. It said that action would be initiated against the factories as per the Tea Marketing Control Order of 2003 and Tea Waste Control Order of 1959. An order has also been issued to all orthodox/dual tea manufacturers in South India to declare the tea waste generated at the factories and to upload the details of the amount of waste produced on the Tea Board’s specific tea waste portal. “The Tea Board is taking concerted efforts to ensure higher price for made tea in the market,” the release said. “During the past few months, the green leaf price has been increasing in a sustainable manner and in the last month, the price has been fixed at ₹27.06 per kg by the board. To sustain this upward trend…intensive inspections have been carried out,” it added.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nParked on a jute mat in front of a small shop on Malayaperumal Street in Broadway, 56-six-year-old S. Gopal is luxuriating in the cool breeze from a small table fan. The fan is also keeping flies from settling on fresh tomatoes kept at the shop. A long and thick rope ensures customers stay at more than an arm’s length, and social distancing is maintained. He wears a face mask and also ensures that his tomatoes are sold only to those who wear face masks. This was Gopal’s work station for at least three decades before he was temporarily relocated to the nearby bus terminus across NSC Bose Road in Broadway in March as part of lockdown restrictions. Along with him, a huge number of other vegetable traders, who together account for total of 250 shops, were relocated to the terminus. Many other vegetable traders on the stretch chose to close their business during the lockdown. Some of them are said to have moved to their native place. Those who moved to the bus terminus used their shops on the stretch as storerooms. “We had only two choices then: Temporarily shut down our business or relocate to the makeshift market to run it. Many shut their shops as it was difficult even to earn the maintenance costs,” says Gopal, who is also secretary, Malayaperumal Street Wholesale Vegetable Traders’ Association. With the State government considerbaly easing lockdown restrictions and restoring many suspended services, including resumption of bus services, from September, all shops, mostly those selling vegetables, from the bus terminus in Broadway were moved to their outlets on Malayaperumal Street. Vegetable traders say they have been witnessing significant footfall since they shifted to their old locality. Similarly, the footfall has increased at the bus terminus, which is maintained by the Greater Chennai Corporation, due to the resumption of bus services from September 7. Many commuters from north Chennai including Parrys’ Corner, Seven Wells, North Beach, Broadway, Flower Bazaar and Royapuram board buses from the terminus to reach various other parts of Chennai and its outskirts. Commuters especially women find it convenient and safe to board buses from this terminus due to the continuous movement of people and the presence of policemen round-the-clock. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe birth of an initiativeFor K. Panayappan, his 18th birthday is memorable because he donated blood for the first time, and he was accompanied by his father. Panyappan has since inspired many others to donate blood.“My father used to donate blood once in two years I would accompany him as a child. I would watch his vein being pierced. After the blood donation, he would be given a juice pack. And I would wait to grab it from him. When I reached the age that would allow me to donate blood, my father suggested that I celebrate the birthday by donating blood and that is how it all started,” says Panayappan. The next year, 2012, on his birthday – July 21 — Panayappan went to Lions Blood Bank, five members of his family in tow. In 2013, when Panayappan was a student of an engineering college, he and nine of his classmates from Sankara Vidyalaya Matriculation Higher Secondary School, most of them from Pammal, started a non-profit, Visumbu, with one of its focus areas being blood donation. Panayappan and his friends are happy that they have created a group whose members are keen on donating blood whenever there is a need for it. “The period 2013-14 marks a high-water mark in our blood donation work. We carried out a blood donation campaign with the support of the children in our colony. We handcrafted posters and attached chocolates to them, and distributed them to children and asked them to take it home. The initiative clicked with their parents learning about our blood donation drive, and some of them supporting it,” says Panayappan who works with a consumer goods comapny. More than 130 people donated blood in that drive.In 2014, they drummed up more support through a digital campaign that drew people from other neighbourhoods in Chennai. In 2015, they extended the programme to conduct two drives a year.A majority of Visumbu’s team members have relocated to other cities but the group’s activities continue unhindered. “Over the last two years, we managed to gather 30 to 40 people for our blood camp. Given the fact that we are busy with our professional life, this number is fine and we are also into career guidance,” he says.Vineesh Vishnu, Raja Kumaran and Piyush Mishra are a few of the other champion blood donors from Visumbu. From being inspired to being the inspirer J. Badrinath has been donating blood for the last 35 years, starting from his thirtieth year when he joined the Lions Club. Particularly inspired by the organisation’s blood donation drives, he became a blood donor, thereby choosing to be an inspiration to others. “I have not kept a count of the number of times I have donated blood. In the early years it would be in three months. Now, I donate blood whenever it is possible, and the frequency has reduced due to age-related restrictions,” says Badrinath, who is a member of Lions Club of Madras Fort St George, and runs a BPO. The 64-year-old whose blood group is B +ve blood is the go-to person whenever there is a requirement for blood, as he quickly organises donors to honour the requirement.The highlight of the drives is that he is a part of the effort to debunk myths around blood donation. A former chairperson of Leo Club, Badrinath was instrumental in raising a group of young people who indefatigably spread awareness about blood and eye donation in their neighbourhoods. Leo Club is the junior wing of the Lions Club International and its members are in the 13 to 30 age group. “In 2017-18, we started 10 Leo chapters and increased its membership from 300 to 3000. These youngsters are ambassadors for us. They seek eye donation pledges from people in their neighbourhoods. When someone needs blood they spread the word within their circles. When children make a request, people oblige,” he says. A winning point about blood donationWhen he came across frequent reports of blood shortage in the country, R. Ethirajan decided to become a donor. Twenty-four years old, an employee of Central Bank of India and a promising table tennis player, he was discouraged by well-intentioned but misinformed friends and family members from doing so, as they felt being a regular blood donor would affect him as a sportsperson. Ethirajan says he has proved all of them wrong.“By being a blood donor and TT champion, I have only been able to spread the word about blood donation better,” says 50-year-old Ethirajan who took voluntary retirement recently. Over the years, he has represented the bank in various tournaments. Initially, people would be surprised to hear that he donates blood once in three months and also plays the sport but it became a great conversation starter. “I got to motivate others to donate blood,” says the Saidapet resident.Ethirajan recalls an incident when he donated blood a day before a major tournament.“In 2001, I received a call for blood donation a day before an Inter Institution Tournament Table Tennis Tournament. I had no problem saying ‘yes’ to it. My team members wondered it I would be able give my best in the tournament and take our team to victory. As it turned out, I could,” he says. The banker has followed the practice of donating blood on January 1. “Many people avoid visiting a hospital on New Year’s Day, as they don’t want to begin the new year that way. But I make it a point to visit a hospital on January 1 and donate blood,” says Ethirajan whose blood group is O+.147 and counting The first time Rohith Fernandes donated blood he was 18, and he was doing it more for the excitement of doing something new than anything else. Today, donating blood is an unshakeable habit for 39-year-old singer who added to his blood donation tally only a few days ago. “At last count, it is 147,” says Rohith who keeps count on his mobile. “Initially, it was a mental calculation but as the count kept increasing I started keeping track of it on my phone. It notifies me when I am next eligible and I also have my platelet count written down. If I am travelling, I plan my donations accordingly,” he says. Rohith went through an transformative incident that led him to see blood donation in a whole new light. “I had donated platelets for a seven-year-old boy with cancer. It was just another activity for me and my friends. A few days later, the boy’s father called to thank me, but I could sense his voice was quivering. Later, I learnt that the child did not survive. The incident really touched me and since then I have been a regular donor,” he says. “When I have enough of something, why not give to someone to save their life,” is the reasoning. “In fact, it has become an addiction for me and I am happy about it.”Apart from being an active donor, Rohith posts verified requirements on social media to encourage others to join the group.‘I do not want to kick this habit’Arul Solai Murugan’s journey as a blood donor started the way it has for many others — donating blood as a birthday initiative. “I was 23 years old when I first donated blood. The procedure actually was uncomfortable — filling a few forms, answering questions about my health and habits,” says Arul. He continued with blood donation for the next five years, and gradually increased the frequency to three times a year. “I have so far donated blood 41 times,” he says. Initially, it was based on requirements posted in groups but now he makes it a point to volunteer to donate blood at regular intervals. “I realised there is a huge shortage and you should not wait for a request to come your way. You have to make it a habit,” he says. Donating blood regularly has led me to work out regularly because I want to be fit enough, he says. Since the pandemic hit, Arul has donated twice. One of them was a request from the Egmore Children’s Hospital. A lady needed blood for a surgery. “My family was apprehensive of me going to the hospital in these times but as long as you have taken all precautions it’s perfectly fine. And it was for a cause,” he says. Finally, it is the ‘thank you’ from the donor that keeps me motivated, adds Arul. \\n',\n",

       " '\\nLess than 24 hours after the oldest ally in the NDA, the Shiromani Akali Dal, announced a parting of ways over the three farm Bills passed last week by Parliament, Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted the benefits of the Bills in his monthly radio broadcast, “Mann ki Baat”.Mr. Modi highlighted instances of farmers breaking free from restrictions imposed by the Agriculture Produce Marketing Committee (APMC) Acts in various States to trade their crops freely and profitably. The Prime Minister’s remarks come after a stormy monsoon session of Parliament where the Bills, aimed at reforming trade in agricultural produce were cleared, sparking protests in various parts of the country by farmers groups and opposition parties.Referring to the Bills, Mr. Modi said, “Farmers now have the power to sell their produce anywhere and to anyone and they have the freedom to grow any crop and to sell it at a price best suited to them.”He recalled instances during the lockdown where farmers in Theni in Tamil Nadu got together and pooled in crops of fruits and vegetables to sell as packages in Chennai.He also spoke of one Ismail bhai of Banaskantha of Gujarat, whose family was wary of his undertaking agriculture as a largely non-remunerative activity. However, because Gujarat ended the APMC system for fruits and vegetables, Ismail Bhai is earning a good profit from his potato crop, Mr. Modi said. Farmers are the basis of the concept of Atmanirbhar Bharat, he added.He also highlighted the power of story telling in disseminating values to the younger generation and spoke of story telling groups in Bengaluru.In the coming weeks, he said, India will be marking the anniversaries related to leaders associated with the freedom struggle and contemporary India. “October 2 marks the birth anniversaries of Mahatma Gandhi and Lal Bahadur Shastri. If we had followed Gandhiji’s path, we would already be atmanirbhar (self reliant),” he said.He mentioned the contributions of revolutionary Bhagat Singh and made a laudable reference to late Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindhia of Gwalior, recalling her maternal touch towards himself and many BJP workers.\\n',\n",

The School and Mass Education Department will launch classroom teaching through All India Radio from Monday. “As the schools could not be opened due to COVID-19 pandemic, we had tried to reach students with online classes, mostly through smart phones. But, virtual classes have their inherent drawbacks. Of the 60 lakh students, we were hardly reaching to 22 lakhs during lockdown,” said State School and Mass Education Minister Sameer Ranjan Dash. Mr. Dash pointed out, “The situation worsened further when lockdown was lifted. Many parents started returning to their workplaces taking the only smart phone in the family with them. As per our assessment, the number of students taking online classed dropped to 6 to 7 lakh after the unlock.” “It is well known that radio can be heard even in the remotest parts. Moreover, radio is cheap compared to expensive smart phones and the recurring cost is also low. We hope to cover more students with the radio school programme,” he said. As per the plan, students from Class I to VIII can learn their lessons through 15-minutes of teaching by experienced teachers through radio. It will be available everyday from 10 a.m. to 10.15 a.m. “A student could cover six pages of his textbook within 15 minutes of radio programme. Though the teaching through radio would not be effective as it could have been in physical classroom, the extraordinary situation has forced us to try different methods for reaching students,” the Minister said. Schools in Odisha have been closed since March 17. However, children have been provided textbooks. Three hours of classroom instruction are also available through Doordarshan. Since considerable time has been lost due closure of schools, school syllabus has been reduced by 30%. Recently, the National Human Rights Commission issued notices to Education Ministry over the inability of students to follow online classes. Human rights lawyer Radhakant Tripathy had moved NHRC stating that 38 lakh students from Odisha were unable to access online education due to unavailability of requisite digital infrastructure. \\n',\n",
       " '\\n Doctors, nurses, fundraisers and volunteers who have made “outstanding contributions” to the U.K.’s coronavirus response will be recognised in the 2020 Queen’s Birthday Honours list to be unveiled on October 10, Downing Street said on Sunday.The list, which is traditionally published in early June to coincide with the 94-year-old monarch’s official birthday celebrations, was postponed this year in order to consider nominations of people playing crucial roles during the first months of the COVID-19 effort. Downing Street said that following approval from Queen Elizabeth II, hundreds of additional people will be honoured for their contributions tackling the deadly virus on the frontline and in their communities. They will appear alongside recipients that were already due to be recognised for a broad range of achievements before the pandemic.“As we all redouble our efforts to control the virus, protect the NHS and save lives this winter, I am pleased we have an opportunity to recognise those who have given so much to this country already,” said Prime Minister Boris Johnson.“The coronavirus pandemic is the greatest health challenge in our lifetime. We all have to play our part, but the dedication, courage and compassion seen from these recipients, be it responding on the frontline or out in their communities providing support to the most vulnerable, is an inspiration to us all. “We owe them a debt of gratitude and the 2020 Queen’s Birthday honours will be the first of many occasions where we can thank them as a nation,” he said. This year’s so-called “bumper list” follows Mr. Johnson’s call in May for nominations for those going over and above in response to the pandemic. As the first list to incorporate COVID-19 nominations during the ongoing pandemic, the 2020 Queen’s Birthday list is designed to prioritise frontline and community heroes.  The recipients, including elderly fundraiser Captain Sir Tom Moore, are described as “outstanding examples” of the contributions which are still being made right across the U.K., and are symbolic of the “ongoing, collective national effort”. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe provincial government in Pakistan’s Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa has decided to purchase the ancestral houses of legendary Bollywood actors Raj Kapoor and Dilip Kumar to conserve the historic buildings which are in dilapidated condition and facing demolition threat. The Department of Archaeology in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province has decided to allocate sufficient funds for purchasing the two buildings, which have been declared as the national heritage and lie in the heart of Peshawar city, an official said.  An official letter has been sent to the Deputy Commissioner of Peshawar to determine the cost of both the historic buildings, where the two greats of Indian cinema were born and raised in their early days before the partition, said Dr .Abdus Samad Khan, the head of department of archaeology. Raj Kapoor’s ancestral home, known as Kapoor Haveli, is situated in the fabled Qissa Khwani Bazar. It was built between 1918 and 1922 by the legendary actor’s grandfather Dewan Basheswarnath Kapoor. Raj Kapoor and his uncle Trilok Kapoor were born in the building. It has been declared national heritage by the provincial government. Veteran actor Dilip Kumar’s over 100-year-old ancestral house is also located in the same locality. The house is in shambles and was declared as national heritage in 2014 by the then Nawaz Sharif government.Mr. Khan said the owners of the two buildings made many attempts in the past to demolish them for constructing commercial plazas in view of their prime location but all such moves were stopped as the archaeology department wanted to preserve them keeping in view their historic importance.However, the owner of Kapoor Haveli, Ali Qadar, said that he did not want to demolish the building and made many contacts with the archaeology department officials to protect and preserve this historic structure which is a national pride. The owner has demanded ₹200 crore from the KP government to sell it out to the government. In 2018, the Pakistan government decided to convert the Kapoor Haveli into a museum, heeding to a request by Rishi Kapoor who died this year in Mumbai. However, the announcement to this effect could not be materialised despite a lapse of around two years. There are around 1,800 historic structures in Peshawar which are over 300 years old.\\n',\n",

Further, the company said it is in the best position to upgrade 2G customers also to 4G, but it will continue with basic voice based services to its 2G subscribers.“While the company will continue to offer basic voice services to its 2G users, 3G data users will gradually be upgraded to 4G in a phased manner across all markets. VIL has started informing its customers in the markets where re-farming is getting completed,” it said in a statement. With the highest quantum of spectrum in the country and a large part of it already re-farmed for 4G, VIL is now best placed to upgrade 2G and 3G users to high speed 4G data services, Vodafone Idea managing director and CEO Ravinder Takkar said. “As our integration nears completion, we have already expanded our 4G coverage to 1 billion Indian population who can now avail faster data services pan-India,” he added. Out of total mobile customer base of 30.5 crore at the end of June, the company had 11.6 crore mobile broadband users on its network, of which 10.4 crore were 4G customers and rest were on 3G network.  VIL said that consolidation of Vodafone and Idea network has substantially enhanced its 4G capacity with deployment of latest technologies through which it has been able to deploy 4G in radiowaves that were earlier being used for 3G.“VIL will now be able to offer faster 4G data speeds to its 3G users on the Vi GIGAnet network. The company’s enterprise customers currently using 3G based services will be upgraded to 4G and 4G based IoT applications and services, in a phased manner,” the statement said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nOutstation patients being brought to Delhi in “very sick state” for treatment, and “time lapse” in transferring to hospital home quarantined persons whose health has deteriorated, could be among the factors behind the high number of COVID-19 fatalities recorded here in the last few days, say experts.Doctors at leading government facilities and private hospitals in Delhi on Sunday also concurred that the deaths being reported now are “mostly of patients aged 60 and above with co-morbidities”.The national capital reported 46 COVID-19 deaths on Saturday, the highest in over 70 days, taking the toll to 5,193, while 3,372 fresh cases pushed the tally to 2,67,822. This is the highest number of coronavirus deaths reported in a day in Delhi since July 16, when the city had recorded 58 fatalities.COVID-19 cases have shown a surge since the beginning of this month with September 16 recording 4,473 cases, the highest single-day spike here till date.From September 9-19, fresh cases were recorded in excess of 4,000 per day except on September 14 when the figure stood at 3,229 with 26 deaths being recorded that day, according to official data.However, since September 20, fresh cases have remained below the 4,000-mark.The daily fatalities count from September 15-24 was recorded in excess of 30 on all days. Only on September 25 it stood at 24, jumping again to 46 the next day.Also, the seven-day average of daily COVID-19 cases in India has been gradually declining for nine consecutive days from September 17-26, the first time such a phase of continuous fall has been recorded since the outbreak of the pandemic, according to a report which cites data from European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).Medical Director, Rajiv Gandhi Super Speciality Hospital, Dr. B.L. Sherwal said the fall in the number of daily cases in the last one week is a “very healthy trend” and emphasised that “a lot has been learned about the behaviour of the virus” since the outbreak.“The number of deaths being reported in excess of 30 in the past few days or 46 yesterday, can be attributed to two major reasons -- most of the patients who are dying are in 60s, 70s, 80s or 90s, and the victims are mostly those who had co-morbities,” he told PTI.RGSSH is a dedicated COVID-19 facility under the Delhi government which reported four deaths on Saturday.“Also, a large number of patients coming to Delhi are from neighbouring cities or states, and are being brought in a very sick condition, so again the survival rate is low,” Dr. Sherwal said when asked why death cases are rising when daily cases are now falling.At RGSSH, out of the total 500 beds, 400 are for ICU and HDU patients, and 162 beds in the ICU are occupied, he said.Previously either one or two COVID deaths were occurring daily at the Hospital but on Saturday four patients died, which was a “big number” relatively, Dr.Sherwal added.The average COVID-19 death rate in Delhi for the last 10 days stands at 0.94%, according to Saturday’s health bulletin.Dr. Suranjit Chatterjee, Senior Consultant, Internal Medicine at Apollo Hospitals here, echoed Dr. Sherwal’s view and said outstation patients from Haryana, Madhya Pradesh and other places are being brought to the facilities here in “a very sick condition”.He added that patients from Delhi are also being brought in such a state.“If they are already sick, and have travelled such a long distance, despite the best efforts of doctors and standardised treatment protocols many of these patients die, especially those with co-morbities whose condition can deteriorate suddenly,” he said.Dr. Chatterjee also conjectured that “time lapse” in transferring old patients from home isolation to a hospital could be leading to deaths of many.“There has to be a very low threshold in this transition from home quarantine to a hospital, especially for patients aged 60 and above and having co-morbidities. I would say such patients with co-morbities should rather be sent to any good COVID hospital rather than put under home isolation if we have to save lives,” he said.Dr. Amarinder Singh Malhi, from the Cardiovascular radiology department at AIIMS here, when asked about the daily cases, said, “it is too early to say whether we are past the peak”.The cases may have plateaued or decreased a bit, but there is no significant reduction. People need to behave responsibly in the coming months and step out only if there’s an emergency, he said.Giridhar Babu of the Public Health Foundation of India said there is always a “lag time” in reporting deaths.“Generally 14-17 days after a surge in cases, one will see a high number of deaths being reported. The surge in cases in Delhi could have started two weeks earlier so because of that surge, whatever the hospitalisation-related complications happened are being seen now. If the surge in cases continues, you will have to observe the number of deaths also,” he said.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n When 56-year-old Hymavathi was brought from Nellore to the city for treatment of COVID-19, neither the doctors nor her family doubted the possibility of her recovery. They anticipated a short hospital stay and then return home. The morbidly obese patient, who had no other co-morbid conditions, arrived at the hospital a week after being infected. However, a repeat CT-Scan showed a severe lung involvement. “Such people usually succumb within three to five days. It was a little unprecedented, as also the fact that the patient, in the last 20 days of treatment, did not need a ventilator,” said Balaji Ravilla Baskaran, director of Noble Hospital, where she was treated. The doctor said he was impressed with the determination with which Hymavathi battled the disease. “She maintained her breathing all through the hospitalisation and did not go on ventilator support. On Friday she managed to walk, maintaining her oxygen levels for 15 minutes,” he said. The hospital had initiated her on a low dose of steroids and followed the protocols laid for treatment. Her husband, a jeweller, had also been diagnosed with the infection but he had recovered despite being morbidly obese, Dr. Balaji said. When she came to the hospital her disease was progressing. But in the hospital after 14 days since the disease commenced it started plateauing, he said. The patient was put on a lean and liquid diet to keep her on oxygen mask. “She conserved all her energy to use it to breathe,” Dr. Balaji said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n The Centre has directed deployment of about 30,000 central security force personnel for the conduct of the three-phase Assembly polls in Bihar, officials said on Sunday.The Union Home ministry has directed that 300 companies of the Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) and the Railway Protection Force will be deployed for “area domination to ensure peaceful conduct of assembly polls” in the State. The maximum 80 companies, as per an official order reviewed by PTI, will be drawn from the Central Reserve Police Force (CRFP) followed by 70 from the Sashastra Seema Bal (SSB), 55 from the Border Security Force (BSF), 50 from the Central Industrial Security Force (CISF), 30 from the Indo-Tibetan Border Police force (ITBP) and 15 from the RPF.A single company of these forces has an operational strength of about 100 personnel.“A total of 300 companies or about 30,000 personnel of these CAPFs and the RPF have been ordered to be withdrawn immediately from various units including from the borders and training for deployment in Bihar polls,” a senior officer said. Polls for the 243-member Bihar Assembly will be held in three phases - October 28, November 3 and November 7- and counting of votes will be held on November 10. The Election Commission, while announcing the poll schedule for the State on September 25, had said that the electoral exercise will be one of the biggest elections globally to be held during the prevailing COVID-19 pandemic situation.“Border guarding forces like the ITBP, BSF and SSB have also been asked to withdraw their units and send for the Bihar elections pool. Although, the ITBP is heavily committed due to the current situation along the LAC and the BSF against Pakistan on the western front, these forces could not be spared (from doing poll duty) this time,” a senior officer privy to the development said. Officials have recently said that the home ministry is working on an “ambitious” plan to gradually remove border guarding forces - the BSF, the ITBP and the SSB - from internal security duties in order to strengthen protection at various frontiers of the country. The internal security and conduct of elections task will increasingly be rendered by the CRPF that is designated as the lead internal security force of the country, they had said. The Home Ministry, in the latest order, has said that the CRPF will be the nodal agency for the deployment of these central forces in the State and it will coordinate with the State agencies for moving these contingents in Bihar. The EC had said voting will begin as usual at 7 a.m. in Bihar but the period will be extended by one hour until 6 p.m., except in the Left Wing Extremism affected areas, so that COVID-19 patients can vote in the last hour of the day.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nThe operating manual of the world’s oldest digital computer has been unearthed in a pile of documents in Zurich, according to a blog post from the Association of Computing Machinery written by retired ETH Zurich lecturer Herbert Bruderer. The manual would give researchers a better understanding of how the early computer functioned. According to Bruderer, Zuse Z4 is considered the oldest preserved computer in the world. Built in 1945, the room-sized machine runs on magnetic tapes and needs several people to operate it. Currently, it is housed at the Deutsches Museum in Munich, but hasn’t been used in quite some time. Researchers and historians have had little knowledge of the device since the manual was lost long ago. Evelyn Boesch, an archivist at ETH Zurich University discovered the manual among her father’s documents in March, Bruderer said. Evelyn’s father, René Boesch was a researcher who worked under Manfred Rauscher at the Institute for Aircraft Statics and Aircraft Construction at ETH Zurich. Boesch's first employment was with the Swiss Aeronautical Engineering Association, which was based at the university’s Institute for Aircraft Statics and Aircraft Construction. The Z4 was kept there in the early 1950s.Among Boesch’s documents were notes on the math problems the Z4 solved that were linked to the development of the P-16 jet fighter. “The research revealed that the documents included a user manual for the Z4 and notes on flutter calculations,” Bruderer said. “According to the Historical Lexicon of Switzerland, Rauscher, who was professor of Aircraft Statics and Construction at ETH Zurich from 1950 to 1974, was a consultant on the P-16 fighter aircraft.” According to Boesch’s notes, around 100 jobs were carried out with the Z4 between 1950 and 1955. These included calculations on trajectory of rockets, aircraft wings, flutter vibrations and nosedive. At that time, Z4 was touted as a powerful machine that can run addition and subtraction in half a second, multiplication in 3 seconds, and division and square roots in six seconds. The computer averaged around 1000 mathematical operations in an hour. The computer has a backstory to itself. Z4 was the last computer that the Nazis invented. German civil engineer Konrad Zuse, inventor of the Z4 and the likely author of the manual, completed work on Z4 in Göttingen. Nazis then wanted Zuse to move his Z4 to Mittelbau Dora, where V1 and V2 rockets were being built. Zuse refused to accept the order and fled to a small German town, Bad Hindelang where he hid the computer in a barn. He waited out the war by selling woodcuts to local farmers and American troops. After the World War 2, Z4 became his flagship machine and Zuse was regarded as the father of modern commercial computers. The Z4 was later taken to the Institute of Applied Mathematics at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) in Zurich where it did calculations for Swiss aviation engineers. It was there, that researchers fumbled upon the Z4’s manual among the historical documents related to the planes.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\n Former Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis on Sunday asserted that the BJP has no intention of joining hands with the Shiv Sena or to bring down the Uddhav Thackeray-led state government. Talking to reporters here, Mr. Fadnavis claimed people of the state are “unhappy” with the performance of the Shiv Sena-led Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA) government and it “would collapse due to its own inactions”.The senior BJP leader also said his meeting with Shiv Sena MP Sanjay Raut on Saturday, which prompted speculation in political circles, was regarding an interview for the Sena mouthpiece ‘Saamana’.The Shiv Sena snapped ties with the BJP last year after the Maharashtra Assembly polls over the issue of sharing the chief ministerial post. The Uddhav Thackeray-led party then joined hands with the NCP and the Congress to form MVA government in the state.“We have no intention of joining hands with the Shiv Sena or to bring down the government. When it falls on its own, we will see,” said Mr. Fadnavis, who is the leader of opposition in the state Assembly.“My meeting with Raut had no political connotations”.He asked me for an interview to ‘Saamana’, to which I agreed.But, I had put my conditions- like the interview should be unedited and I should get to put my own camera during the interview. So we met to discuss its nitty-gritties,” he said. Meanwhile, Mr. Raut, who also spoke to reporters here separately, said he and Fadnavis are not enemies and Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray was aware of the meeting which was pre-planned to discuss the interview schedule. However, Congress leader Sanjay Nirupam criticised Mr. Raut, alleging that he was in a hurry to grab headlines.“When that happens, political careers end. This is not my ill-wish for Mr. Raut, but a reality,” the former Mumbai Congress chief told PTI. Mr. Nirupam, who has been sulking since his removal from the post of Mumbai Congress chief ahead of the Lok Sabha polls last year, said if the party is serious about opposing the new farm bills passed by Parliament,it should first ask the ruling Shiv Sena in Maharashtra to spell out its stand. The Congress and the NCP say they will not allow implementation of the new laws in Maharashtra, while Chief Minister Thackeray hasn’t uttered a word on it, he said.“The Shiv Sena supported the farm bills in the Lok Sabha,while it staged a walkout from the RajyaSabha when other opposition parties were demanding a vote on it,” Mr. Nirupam said, adding that farmers in Maharashtra are confused (over the state government’s stand). \\n',\n",
       " \"\\n(Subscribe to our Today's Cache newsletter for a quick snapshot of top 5 tech stories. Click\\xa0here\\xa0to subscribe for free.)Combining data from CAT scans with advanced computing, a team of researchers at Stanford University have developed a predictive fire model to forecast where wildfires might strike. CAT scanners are used for human body scans, however the researchers have used it to understand the process of smouldering – the state of burning without flame. Smouldering may appear harmless, but the smouldering logs are capable of reigniting, while the residual glowing sparks could be carried in the air, and can lead to wildfires in different areas, a Stanford release explained. The team used X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT), to get three-dimensional images of wood structures less than a millimetre in scale as they smoulder and eventually catch fire. It also allows them to measure the temperature of the surrounding flame, it added. The predictive fire model uses information about the flammability of various materials, landscape data, and weather data, like relative humidity in the air and wind patterns. Then, the algorithm runs countless permutations to predict how different combinations alter a fire’s spread, the release noted. “For wildfire risk assessment or if you’re a firefighter, what you need is an accurate prediction about how fast the local fuel – the trees and plants nearby – will burn. Matthias Ihme,” a Mechanical Engineering Professor at Stanford University, said. “We’ve analysed this fuel in a new way that allows us to do just that.” The research team also wants to gather wood samples from around the world, analyse them using XCT and compile a detailed database of various fuels. “We’ve been working on improving the fidelity of the model, adding more complex physics into it,” Matt Bonanni, a Stanford graduate student, says. “It’ll only get better.” \\n\",\n",

The COVID-19 spread in phase one was traced using the travelling history of the patients, and it was found that most of the transmissions were local,” Sarita Azad, Assistant Professor, IIT Mandi, told PTI.“The research team has used the travel history of infected patients from January to April as the primary data source and a social network was created depicting the spread in the early phase of the pandemic. The research found that the maximum numbers of connections were established from Dubai (144) and the UK ( 64),” she added.Ms. Azad explained that statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India.“Dubai’s eigenvector centrality was the highest that made it the most influential node. The statistical metrics calculated from the data revealed that Dubai and the UK played a crucial role in spreading the disease in Indian states and were the primary sources of COVID-19 importations into India.“Based on the modularity class, different clusters were shown to form across Indian states, which demonstrated the formation of a multi-layered social network structure. A significant increase in confirmed cases was reported in states like Tamil Nadu, Delhi and Andhra Pradesh during the first phase of the nationwide lockdown, which spanned from March 25 to April 14,” she said.“The modularity class of States such as Tamil Nadu, Delhi, and Andhra Pradesh was low. Hence, it is likely that infected cases from these states played less of a role in spreading the disease outside their communities. Whereas States like Gujarat, Rajasthan, Maharashtra, Kerala, Jammu and Kashmir, and Karnataka played a significant role in the local transmission, and some of them caused interstate transfer too,” she added.Ms. Azad, who conducted the analytical study, along with her student Sushma Devi, said, “When a pandemic like COVID-19 subsides, a good research work serves as a record for the future. In this work, we have used real time data and demonstrated how the disease got diffused from the global to national level from January 30 to April 6.

He has thereafter never been associated with Dharma Productions for any other project,” Johar said.\\n',\n",

       " '\\n War of words intensified between West Bengal Governor Jagdeep Dhankhar and Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, as they continued to shoot off letters to lash out at each other over a host of issues, the latest bone of contention being the PM-Kisan scheme. The governor on Sunday sent a missive to Ms Banerjee, seeking to know why the State wants to be an “intermediary” in the transfer of central funds to farmers under the PM-Kisan scheme, a day after the CM, in a letter, asked him to “act within the mandates of the Constitution”.Earlier in the week, Ms Banerjee wrote to the Centre, saying that she was ready to implement PM-Kisan and Ayushman Bharat schemes in West Bengal if the funds are routed through the State government.Mr Dhankhar asked the CM to submit the proposal before the State Cabinet for consideration. Describing Ms Banerjee’s request to the Union government as a “retrograde step”, he expressed apprehensions that it might open floodgates of corruption.“National policy is ‘minimum government, maximum governance’, why this approach of ‘maximum government, minimum governance’?” the governor asked in the letter, which he also posted on Twitter. Contending that the “recent rampant corruption with patronage to undeserving favourites in Amphan relief and PDS is fresh memory”, Mr Dhankhar said it was “time to be transparently fair to farmers”.Shockwaves all around that the Mamata Banerjee government seeks to be intermediary agent, he wrote, calling upon the chief minister to submit her proposal to the Cabinet for consideration.“All are justifiably alarmed and concerned as to why the State government seeks to be an intermediary agent, at the cost of farmers, in PM-KISAN which provides seamless, transparent and accountable direct transfer of fund to farmers,” Mr Dhankhar said. He claimed that the move has “dangerous potential to open floodgates of corruption and sap the essence of efficacy of the entire scheme that has found favour and appreciation all over the country, except in West Bengal”.The Governor also said that the denial of central scheme benefits to the farmers of West Bengal have cost each of them at least ₹12,000 so far and the farming sector of the state around ₹8,400 crore. He maintained that the implementation of the PM-Kisan scheme would have benefited the state’s farmers to the tune of ₹30,000 crore, as the Centre had announced a nationwide package of ₹3.5 lakh crore for the farm sector, amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Under the PM-Kisan scheme, the central government offers ₹6,000 annually in three equal instalments to the farmers. The amount is directly transferred into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. \\n',\n",

The police had earlier registered a case against the man, one Vijay.P.Nair, residing near Gandhari Amman Koil in the capital, for outraging the modesty of women. Though he had initially told the police that he did not have any complaint, he later changed stance and lodged a complaint with the Thampanoor police.

       " '\\n Just as principles of net neutrality have been applied to telecom networks, neutrality of platforms, app stores, operating systems, and devices are crucial aspects that will need to be examined and ensured in the digital era, outgoing TRAI chief RS Sharma has said.Mr Sharma termed this as a “new frontier” that merits attention, and emphasised that ‘neutrality’ is important to ensure that devices, operating systems and digital platforms don’t emerge as “new gatekeepers” or exercise arbitrary controls.“Who will get into that area...I am not saying whether Trai should do it, or who someone else...I am saying neutrality of devices, operating systems and platforms is something that should be examined and ensured,” he told PTI.Mr Sharma - whose tenure at the helm of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) is slated to end on September 30 - further said that at a time when internet has become all-pervasive, smartphones and devices are the medium to access software, operating system, and app stores. “Platforms, Operating Systems, devices...if they are not neutral they can become new gatekeepers...telecom service providers will not exhibit this behaviour because of net neutrality principles,” he said. In the realm of telecom networks, net neutrality principles prohibit service providers from discriminating against internet content and services by blocking, throttling or according preferential higher speeds. Simply put, this means that entire internet traffic should be available to everyone on equal terms without general discrimination. Earlier, the government had accepted TRAI’s recommendations on net neutrality in telecom networks with slight modifications to the regulator’s suggestion, and had then approached it for additional views on nuances like traffic management practices (TMPs) and multi-stakeholder body. TRAI recently mooted that the telecom department should establish a multi-stakeholder body to ensure that internet access providers adhere to the provisions of net neutrality, as it spelt out the broad contours of the proposed panel.  The role of the proposed panel - comprising telecom service providers and internet providers and other stakeholders such as the content providers, researcher, academic and technical community, civil society organisations, consumers, and the government - would be to provide advice and support to Department of Telecom in monitoring and enforcement of net neutrality principles, TRAI had said in its latest recommendations on the issue.\\n',\n",

He however, added that their demands have been partially met.Also read | Leh’s People’s Movement to boycott council electionsThe delegation decided to call off the boycott on an assurance from the Centre that “Government of India is open to discuss protection available under the Sixth Schedule... while looking into issues related to Ladakhi people.”Union Sports minister Kiren Rijiju, who met the delegation including Skyabje Thiksey Khampo Rinpochey, the head of the Thiksay monastery in Ladakh, said on Sunday, “The delegation was assured that all issues related to language, demography, ethnicity, land and jobs will be considered positively/ taken care of.”“A dialogue between a larger Ladakhi delegation comprising of representatives from Leh and Kargil Districts under the aegis of Peoples Movement for Constitutional safeguard under Sixth Schedule and Union Home Ministry would commence after 15 days of the culmination of LAHDC, Leh elections. Any decision reached in this connection would be in consultation with the representatives from Leh and Kargil,” Mr. Rijiju said at a press conference along with members of the delegation.Union Minister of State for Home G.

       " '\\nThe Alliance of Doctors for Ethical Health Care (ADEH) has expressed anguish and disappointment over the recent reply by the Minister of Chemicals and fertilizers Sadanada Gowda in the Parliament that there is no decision yet from the part of the government to make Uniform Code of Pharmaceutical Marketing Practices (UCPMP) mandatory.“UCPMP should be made mandatory to bring fairness in marketing of the drugs as the industry has failed to comply with the code on a voluntary basis,” said the group in its release.The UCPMP was made voluntary for six months from 1st January 2015. It was to be reviewed after six months. ADEH has been demanding from time to time that the UCPMP be made mandatory to bring fairness in marketing of the drugs.“The global experience also shows that voluntary code does not work. The government in 2016 had indicated that it would make the code statutory. But now this U-turn raises suspicion of lack of will on the part of the government to keep its commitment and smells of some unfair deals between the government and the pharma companies,” noted a statement issued by the group.The group added that the issue has been brought to the fore as the non-compliance of the code by the pharma companies adds to the cost of drugs and encourages corrupt practices.“It may be pointed out here that the companies spend crores of rupees through associations by sponsoring the medical conferences. They spend a huge amount on travel, accommodation and other expenditures on the doctors for lavish arrangements of the conferences,” said Babu KV, member of ADEH.He said that as per clause 7.2 of the UCPMP “companies or their associations/representatives shall not extend any hospitality like hotel accommodation to healthcare practitioners and their family members under any pretext”.“The implied meaning of this is that even extending benefits to the doctors through associations is unethical. But this is being flouted with impunity by the pharma companies to promote their business,” he said.ADEH said that it may be pointed out here that the then minister Ananth Kumar had said in the Rajya Sabha in June 2016 that the voluntary code which was introduced in 2015 has not yielded desired results and the government would make it mandatory.“Therefore the present stance of the government is highly skeptical. The ADEH demands that the UCPMP should be made mandatory immediately,” added Arun Mitra, member ADEH.\\n',\n",

I used to ask them for stories, they would say that they would tell jokes instead. That used to astound me, we have a settled tradition of storytelling and Katha in our society,” he said. “Nowadays science fiction is also popular.”He mentioned Amar Vyas who has started a gaatha website. “Vaishali Vyavahare Deshpande in Marathi, Srividya Veeraraghavan of Chennai, Kathalaya and the Indian Storytelling Network are popularising storytelling and forming networks of storytellers,” he said.Aparna Atreya, Aparna Jaishankar, Shailaja Sampath and Sowmya Srinivasan join from Bengaluru Storytelling Society and narrate a story on Krishna Deva Raya and Tenali Rama. Ms. Athreya thanked the PM for highlighting the importance of storytelling.Speaking on the importance of stories to impart good values and sanskar to the children, Mr. Modi requested all storytellers to document and disseminate stories from our freedom movement and our travails under colonialism, to mark 75 years of independence.Seydu Dembele of Mali in West Africa joined the call, recalled attending the Kumbh Mela in the past and expressed desire to visit again. Every afternoon, Mr. Dembele hosts a radio broadcast called Indian Frequency on Bollywood songs. He is known as “Mali’s Indian Babu”.‘Keeping produce out of APMCs proved beneficial’“There is a saying: he who is rooted, will remain unshaken by the biggest storms. Our agricultural sector and farmers are such. They form the basis of aatmanirbhar Bharat (self-reliant India),” Mr. Modi said.“I receive letters from farmers about the way agriculture is changing.”Quoting Kanwar Chauhan, a farmer from Haryana, Mr. Modi said he used to have problems selling fruits and vegetables outside mandis, but since 2014, when fruits and vegetables were kept out of the APMCs, he made bigger profits by supplying directly to big hotels and retail chains.“Around three to four years ago, in Maharashtra too, fruits and vegetables were kept out of the APMCs and trade now proceeds without middlemen.”The PM gave an example of a Theni farmers produce company who grow bananas. “During the lockdown, they bought tonnes of vegetables and fruits and sold combo kits to Chennai, benefitting everyone.”In Lucknow too, such direct selling was seen, middlemen were cut out and profits were directly earned by farmers, he said. “Consumers got items at reasonable .”“Ismail bhai of Banaskantha of Gujarat grows high-yielding potatoes and sells directly to big retailers.”The more modern alternatives we have for agriculture, the faster it will grow, he said.‘Nurture desire to do something for our country’Mr. Modi spoke about the Jallianwala Bagh incident: “A 12-year-old boy visited the site of the massacre and it left his mind burning with vengeance. I’m speaking of Shaheed Vir Bhagat Singh. We will be marking his Jayanti on 28 September. He managed to sow fear in the minds of an imperial power like the British. He was also a thinker and believed in team work. He lived for a mission of independence and gave his life for it.”Similarly, we must nurture the desire to do something for our country, he said. “Last year, the world saw this in the commitment of our soldiers in the surgical strikes.”“In the next few weeks, we will recall many of our idols on their birth anniversaries: October 2 will mark Gandhi Jayanti and also the birth of Lal Bahadur Shastri; October 11 is the Jayanti of Jayprakash Narayan as well as Nanaji Deshmukh; October 12 is the jayanti of Rajmata Vijayaraje Scindia, who, despite being royalty dedicated her life to the people.”Mr. Modi recalls that during the Ekta Yatra under M.M. Joshi’s leadership, when they reached Shivpuri around 2 a.m., “someone knocked on my door and Rajmataji was standing before me with a glass of hot turmeric milk.” “I later found out she did so for everyone on that Yatra.

       " '\\n The iconic East Bengal club will make its debut in the Indian Super League this season, the organisers of the football tournament announced on Sunday. The century-old club’s inclusion in ISL this season was on expected lines after its new investors, Kolkata-based Shree Cement Limited, picked up the bid documents to enter the ISL.  A consortium of Shree Cement Limited and East Bengal, known as Shree Cement East Bengal Foundation, had submitted the bid documents to FSDL.  East Bengal will be the 11th team in the competition, which will be played at three venues in Goa this year due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Welcoming East Bengal into the ISL, FSDL chairperson Nita Ambani said the Red and Golds’ inclusion after arch-rivals Mohun Bagan, who merged with ATK, in the country’s top division, is a monumental development for the Indian football ecosystem at large.“It is such a happy and proud moment for ISL as we welcome East Bengal FC and their millions of fans into the League. The inclusion of both legacy clubs, i.e. East Bengal and Mohun Bagan (now ATK Mohun Bagan) opens limitless possibilities for Indian football, especially for talent development in the State,” Ms. Ambani said in a statement. “West Bengal has made an immense contribution to the growth of the beautiful game in India. ISL’s growing footprint in the state and across India, is yet another step towards our mission of building a competitive and robust football ecosystem in the country.” \\n',\n",
       " '\\n Yet to fire with the bat in the tournament so far, Kolkata Knight Riders skipper Dinesh Karthik has admitted that he needs to up his own game in the coming matches of the Indian Premier League.  Young Shubman Gill shone with an unbeaten 62-ball 70 as KKR overwhelmed Sunrsiers Hyderabad by seven wickets for their first win. Aftre making a 23-ball 30 in a losing cause in their tournament opener against Mumbai Indians, Karthik failed to open his account on Saturday. While he was delighted with his team’s convincing win, Karthik, who was dismissed for a three-ball duck, said he will look to get going in the coming matches.“One duck doesn’t make you a bad player. I need to probably up my game and get a few runs,” Karthik said at the post-match presentation ceremony. He added, “Always good to get on board. We have been working really hard. I think one of the advantages of having all-rounders and it is a privilege to use them whenever I can.” Karthik also praised the performances of his young players. “The fact that we have been able to groom the youngsters is pleasing. It has been an emotional journey for us with (Kamlesh) Nagarkoti for the last couple of years. “But credit to the management to have stuck to him. It feels good to see the youngsters doing well. I want Gill to enjoy his journey in cricket,” he said. His counterpart David Warner, who opted to bat after winning the toss, said his team needs to hit more boundaries. Bowling a disciplined line and length with world number one Pat Cummins leading the way, KKR restricted SRH to 142 for four.“I think I got my decision right. For us, our strength is death bowling. I thought it was actually a difficult wicket to accelerate on. The Kolkata boys showed us that if you can keep wickets at the end, that’s what wins you games,” Warner said. “I don’t regret what I did at the beginning of the game and I stick by my decision. Patty Cummins, as he does, (bowled) Test match line and length. There was a little bit of movement here and there. “We went four or five overs for 20 and coming back with three wickets in hand at the end probably killed us a little bit there. An extra 30 or 40 runs would have been great.” The prolific Australian opener added, “We have to try and go harder at the top. Can’t help if the bowlers are bowling good lines and lengths. We need to push as hard as we can.“You can see from our running between the wickets, we do do that. But, we got to improve our boundary percentage. I saw, I think 35 dot balls, which not acceptable in T20 cricket on a wicket that was actually nice to bat on.” Asked about his team’s top-scorer Manish Pandey, who looked in some discomfort while going off the ground, Warner said, “Not sure. Hopefully, bit of a cramp.” \\n',\n",

       " '\\nThere was jubilation among the Manipuris who have been in Assam, Tripura and other northeastern States for generations, as the Assam government will translate into action the Manipuri language demands. The assurances were given by Assam Education and Health Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, during a meeting in Silchar, Assam, on September 26.Arambam Nandababu, vice-president of the Manipur Language Protection Coordination Committee, said, “Manipuri language is not one of the official associate languages in Assam. As such the Manipuri candidates of the Assam Public Service Commission and other recruitment tests conducted by Assam government departments are handicapped.”The officially recognised associate languages for such tests are Assamese, Bengali and Bodo. Mr. Nandababu said if Manipuri is made an official associate language, the Manipuri candidates could write in their mother tongue in the competitive examinations.The Assam government had recognised Manipuri in the lower primary schools in 1956. It is taught at the graduate level under the Gauhati university.Mr. Nandababu said the Assam government had recently started granting ₹5 lakh as annual financial assistance to the Assam Manipuri Sahitya Parishad. Besides it created a corpus by sanctioning ₹6 crore for the development of the Manipuri language.Mr. Sarma said all other demands can be conceded in a matter of days. However, he sought some time to look into the demand of inclusion of Manipuri in the list of associate languages of Assam. He said the government would like to examine the mechanism of such a demand in other States.The population of the Manipuris in Assam, Tripura, Myanmar and Bangladesh is considerable. Many of them had fled Manipur to dodge the marauding invaders from the bellicose neighbours. Some others were taken as prisoners of war. In case of Assam, a prince had married a princess of Manipur. The Manipur king had decreed mass migration of one or two villages to Assam so that his daughter would not feel insulated due to language barrier. \\n',\n",

       " \"\\nFormer Union minister Jaswant Singh passed away on Sunday morning after a long illness at the Army’s Research and Referral Hospital in New Delhi. He was 82. He is survived by his wife and two sons, including former Barmer MP Manvendra Singh.Hospital officials said he had been admitted on June 25 and was being treated for sepsis and multi-organ dysfunction syndrome and effects of severe head injury sustained earlier. He suffered a cardiac arrest this morning.A veteran leader who held the positions of finance, defence and external affairs minister in the Union governments headed by Atal Behari Vajpayee, Mr. Singh’s career was storied and eventful, reflecting much of India’s strategic turns in the 1990s and early 2000s.Prime Minister Narendra Modi condoled the death of the former Union minister, tweeting: “Jaswant Singhji served our nation diligently, first as a soldier and later during his long association with politics. During Atalji’s Government, he handled crucial portfolios and left a strong mark in the worlds of finance, defence and external affairs. Saddened by his demise.”From both HousesMr Singh, a former Army man had dabbled in politics in his native Rajasthan in the 1960s after leaving the Army, but came into the limelight in 1980, being elected to the Rajya Sabha by the newly formed BJP, which had shed its old Jan Sangh avatar. He remained a member of Parliament from 1980 to 2014, being elected to the Rajya Sabha five times — in 1980, 1986, 1998, 1999, 2004 — and four times to the Lok Sabha — in 1990, 1991, 1996, 2009.Suave and well versed in language and diplomatese, he soon found a place as the BJP’s go-to man for strategic affairs as well as finance, while also serving for a spell as deputy chairperson of the Planning Commission. He was also the Leader of the Opposition in the Rajya Sabha between 2004-2009.\\n\\n\\nAlso Read\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nReactions to Jaswant Singh's death | Left a strong mark as a soldier and parliamentarian, says PM Modi\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMr Singh, who was a close personal friend of former prime minister Vajpayee and deputy prime minister L.K. Advani, was seen as not being an RSS man, and the organisation is said ensured that his name did not figure as finance minister in the first Vajpayee government.He was nevertheless entrusted with many sensitive assignments on behalf of the NDA government, including negotiating with the United States for the easing of sanctions when India tested a nuclear device at Pokhran in 1998, which U.S. representative Strobe Talbot has written about in his book Engaging India: Democracy, Diplomacy and the Bomb.Kandahar episodeHis career, however, was also marred by controversy; first when he was in government during the 1999 Kandahar hijacking. Mr Singh had escorted three terrorists — Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, Masood Azhar and Mushtaq Ahmad Zargar — to Kandahar in exchange for the 175 passengers of the hijacked flight IC 814 who were being held hostage by Pakistan-backed terrorists.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArmed Taliban fighters pass the hijacked Indian Airlines jet at Kandahar airport in Afghanistan in December 1999.\\n\\xa0\\n| Photo Credit: Reuters \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile that controversy created a lasting debate on how to deal with such situations in the future and beefing up security at Indian airports, Mr Singh was caught in another row when the BJP lost the elections in 2009. In a letter to senior party leaders just before they met in Shimla for a review, he demanded a serious enquiry into the causes of the defeat. This caused panic in the party’s ranks. Later, Mr. Singh’s book on Pakistan’s founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah, Jinnah: India, Partitiion, Independence was considered sympathetic to the late leader and led to his expulsion from the party.Despite being elected to the Lok Sabha in 2009 from Darjeeling, he remained on the sidelines for a while till he was brought back into the party by then president Nitin Gadkari. In 2014, however, his desire to contest Lok Sabha elections on a BJP ticket from Barmer was thwarted and he fought as a rebel candidate against the party’s candidate Sona Ram Choudhary. He was defeated and this led to a bitter parting from the BJP.In August 2014, he suffered a fall at his home in Delhi and had been in poor health since. Prime Minister Modi visited the ailing leader and a half-way house of goodwill emerged. On Sunday morning, Mr. Singh breathed his last.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\n\",\n",

A Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni directed two university students who had petitioned the court, seeking a stay on the examinations, to instead approach the vice-chancellor for any relief that they sought. Following the Supreme Court’s order that final year students can only be promoted based on examinations, the Mumbai University issued a circular announcing the schedule for the third-year final semester examinations. The exams will be conducted virtually between October 1 and October 17. The university’s counsel Rui Rodrigues told the Bench on Saturday that the examinations will be conducted online in a multiple-choice question format. The petitioners, however, argued through their counsel Sharon Patole that the university had announced the exam schedule in haste. Mr. Patole informed theBbench that the format was new, and students and teachers should have been given some training to get accustomed to it. The petitioners also said that the schedule was in breach of the university’s own circular from June this year, whereby it had said that colleges must announce exam schedules at least a month in advance. However, Mr. Rodrigues argued that the university had decided on holding online exams in view of the COVID-19 pandemic and that it had made all arrangements to conduct them smoothly.

       " '\\nBelarus’ foreign minister on Saturday warned Western nations against imposing sanctions over the country’s disputed presidential election and crackdown on protesters, saying their expressions of concern are nothing but attempts to bring chaos and anarchy to our country.With the European Union and Britain contemplating sanctions, Belarusian Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei told the virtual UN General Assembly meeting of world leaders that interference in our internal affairs, sanctions and other restrictions on Belarus will have the opposite effect and are harmful for absolutely everyone. We call on our partners to demonstrate wisdom, restraint and impartiality, he said in a pre-recorded speech for the UN session held online because of the coronavirus pandemic.Mr. Makei’s speech was played hours after the latest in a series of large protests in Belarus over the August 9 re-election of President Alexander Lukashenko, which his opponents say was rigged. The authoritarian leader further angered opponents this week by taking the oath of office for a new term in an unexpected and secretive ceremony.The demonstrations are by far the largest and most persistent in Belarus since its independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991. Mr. Makei’s remarks to the international community, which included saying the people made their choice in the election, could fuel further protests Sunday.The rallies are typically largest on Sundays, sometimes drawing crowds of up to 200,000 people.In the first three days of demonstrations in August, police used tear gas, truncheons and rubber bullets to disperse crowds. Several protesters died, many were injured and around 6,000 were detained.Amid international outrage over the crackdown, Belarusian authorities switched to prosecuting top activists. Many members of the Coordination Council, a group that the opposition formed to push for a transition of power, have been arrested or forced to leave the country.Last week, the UN’s Human Rights Council passed a resolution calling for an investigation into possible human rights violations by Lukashenko’s government, with a report to come by the end of the year.The United States and the European Union have questioned the election and criticised the police actions toward peaceful protesters.The EU is pondering sanctions for top Belarusian officials, but it failed to agree on imposing them this week and plans to continue discussions in the coming week. Meanwhile, Britain said Thursday it was working on sanctions and also was in discussions with the US and Canada.EU Council President Charles Michel told the General Assembly on Friday in his own video speech that repression and intimidation must stop and those responsible must be held accountable.We stand with the Belarusian people who must be free, without any external coercion, to choose their own future, Mr. Michel said, calling for inclusive national dialogue facilitated by the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe.Mr. Lukashenko has bristled at suggestions of starting a dialogue with the opposition and has cast the protests as part of a Western plot to isolate Russia, Belarus’ his main sponsor and ally.Mr. Makei said the situation in Belarus indeed has become complex, but he dismissed Western countries’ complaints as meddling statements brimming with cynicism.In actual fact, they are nothing but attempts to bring chaos and anarchy to our country to make Belarus lose many years of development, the foreign minister said.\\n',\n",

And the coaches are in no hurry to rush them on.Managing expectations“One of the most important things is to manage expectations. They will not come back at their old levels immediately. It is important to accept things as they are and give yourself and your players that time. “I know the NFL has had 26 hamstring and six ACL injuries in two weeks.“ We have to be careful, not rush in too soon because you really need to have patience,” women’s chief coach Sjoerd Marijne said during a Hockey India webinar on Saturday on resumption of activities.Goalkeeper Savita agreed, adding that training during lockdown was not at the same level as before. “We did some activities in the hostel also.“There were light sessions with Janneke (Schopman) and Wayne (Lombard) on agility, reflexes, footwork, eye contact etc.,” she explained.Marijne also insisted that restarting camps was necessary for players’ fitness.“We need all the time we can get. It takes time to get back to the levels we were at. You go up very quickly but it also breaks down really fast and in lockdown, you can’t move much. “Playing hockey is not the same as doing exercises in your room, which makes it harder to come back to old levels of fitness, without injuries. “Others like Netherlands are already playing every week and if we don’t do it now, we will get further behind those countries,” he said.Used to restrictionsP.R. Sreejesh admitted the restrictions were initially a struggle but were now routine. “We were like free birds suddenly put in cages when COVID first struck, forced to follow guidelines we had never known before. “The Pro League games were fantastic and now we are without competition for almost 6-7 months. “We had to do everything consciously early on but now masks and sanitisers are part of the routine and everyone’s mentally prepared to adjust to the existing situation,” he said.\\n',\n",

A handball that had gone unnoticed on the field was spotted by the VAR near the end of Madrid’s match at Real Betis, sending Sergio Ramos to the spot to convert an 82nd-minute penalty and take a 3-2 victory in Seville. The review revealed that Betis defender Marc Bartra hit the ball with his arm during a brush with Madrid substitute Borja Mayoral in the area. It seemed that Mayoral’s attempt to kick the ball pushed Bartra’s arm into the ball. Manuel Pellegrini, Betis’ new coach and former Madrid manager, said he had no problem with the refereeing. Madrid played with an extra man from the 67th when Betis defender Emerson was red-carded for fouling Luka Jovic with only the goalkeeper to beat. The referee’s decision was also aided by video. Karim Benzema, the heart of Madrid’s title run last season, set up Federico Valverde for the 14th-minute opener, and pressured Emerson into scoring an own goal while trying to defend a dangerous cross to the French striker to make it 2-2. Benzema also had a strike that hit the crossbar and almost crossed the goal-line. \"The important thing is our mentality. We came out of halftime motivated to take control of the game,” Ramos said. “We should learn from this. We can’t always fight back.” Aissa Mandi and William Carvalho scored for a Betis that won its first two matches under Pellegrini. Midfielder Sergio Canales provided key passes in both Betis goals. \"We take away the feeling that we are doing things correctly,” Pellegrini said. “We created more chances than they did in the first half. (But) Real Madrid can score at any moment.” Barcelona, Atlştico Madrid and Sevilla all open their league campaigns on Sunday after having their first two rounds postponed for playing in European competition in August. JOVIC SIGHTING In a surprise move, Zinedine Zidane gave a rare start to little used Jovic, the striker who scored only twice in limited minutes last season after transferring from Eintracht. Zidane may send him back to the bench after a subdued performance that featured only his race toward the area once launched on the counterattack by Benzema that ended in the red-card foul by Emerson. Valencia was fortunate against newly promoted Huesca to salvage 1-1 at home.Daniel Wass got Valencia on the board in the 38th when his free kick intended as a cross into the area bounced untouched past four players, including Huesca goalkeeper Andrşs Fernŕndez, who was caught expecting a deflection. The visitors came close to the winner when Shinji Okazaki volleyed off the crossbar. Valencia lost striker Rodrigo Moreno to Leeds, winger Ferran Torres to Manchester City, and midfielder Dani Parejo to Villarreal in the offseason and did not replace them. The team has one win in three rounds. \"We have to be self-critical. We didn’t win because we didn’t play well, not because we need reinforcements,” new Valencia coach Javi Gracia said. SOCIEDAD WINS Mikel Merino passed for two goals as Real Sociedad beat Elche 3-0 for its first victory after drawing its first two matches. Merino, a midfielder, made his debut for Spain this month. David Silva got his first start for Sociedad after returning to Spain following his title-filled stint at City. Also, Getafe was held at winless Alavşs to 0-0. \\n',\n",
       " '\\n As many as 33 child marriages were reported in Madurai district from March 25 to August-end, during the COVID-19 pandemic-induced lockdown. Data obtained from the district administration. shows 30 child marriages were stopped by the officials and the first information report was filed in the remaining three cases.Collector T.G.Vinay says officials from the Social Welfare Department, Childline, District Child Protection Office and the police department worked in tandem to stop the child marriages. Out of the 13 blocks in Madurai district, the highest number of child marriages were reported in Usilampatti. There were no child marriage cases reported in Chellampatti, Tirumangalam and T. Kallupatti during that period.  “There was no significant increase in child marriages reported in the district during the lockdown period, when compared to pre-COVID-19 times,” says Mr. Vinay. However, the very prevalence of child marriage is a matter of concern and needs to be addressed immediately, opine women and child rights activists. According to Jim Jessudos, Director of Childline, patriarchal mindset was the root cause for child marriages. “Parents consider their daughters to be a financial burden and so want to marry them off as early as possible,” he says. The fear of inter-caste marriages is another major reason, says Managing Trustee of Justice Shivaraj V. Patil Foundation S. Selva Gomathi. “It is important for parents to sit down and talk to their daughters and try to understand their needs,” she says.Poor family conditions and the anxiety over paying hefty dowry for the daughters also drive parents to marry off their daughters early, says Mr. Jessudos. “Apart from these factors, the uncertainty compounded by the COVID-19 pandemic drove parents to arrange marriage for their girl children. Also, the parents wanted to utilise the lockdown restrictions which called for conducting a simple wedding without many guests,” he says. Child Welfare Committee member B. Pandiaraja says that in some instances the parents arranged marriage for their daughters with their family members, as they consider it to be a safety measure. Empowerment of girls through education and sensitising the families on the adversities of child marriages are important to tackle this issue, says Mr. Jesudoss. In families where there are more than one girl child, the government must support the girl children to complete their higher education, says Ms. Selva Gomathi. The Collector says they are analysing the reasons for the occurrence of child marriages and the places where such cases are reported. “We are focussing on sensitising the parents on the ill-effects of child marriages. We also tell them that the health of girl children will be affected if they are married off at a young age. We have also issued 10,000 postcards for girl children, so that they can report to us about any distress they face,” he says. Childline operates a helpline, ‘1098,’ for children in distress across the country.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nFormer India offspinner Ramesh Powar has requested the Mumbai Cricket Association (MCA) to be considered for the post of Mumbai’s Ranji Trophy head coach for the forthcoming season.Powar was involved as the spin bowling coach at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) but the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) last week decided to relieve a group of coaches at NCA, including Powar, as part of its restructuring move. As a result, Powar is understood to have approached the MCA Cricket Improvement Committee (CIC) to be allowed to appear for an interview despite the delay.The CIC had on September 14 interviewed all the 24 candidates shortlisted for the coaching positions of various MCA teams. It will now be up to MCA secretary Sanjay Naik and CIC chairman Lalchand Rajput to decide whether to call Powar for an interview. Former Mumbai coach Sulakshan Kulkarni and former India speedster Salil Ankola were front-runners, with Amit Pagnis as dark-horse.Powar, one of the stalwarts of Mumbai cricket for well over a decade, has an impressive coaching resume after retiring from First Class cricket in 2015. Besides his NCA appointment, he has had stints at the MCA Indoor Academy and with the India Women’s head coach.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nA businessman from Mahoba, who died a week after he was found with a bullet wound in the neck in his car, after he had accused an IPS officer of threatening to kill him, was shot with his own pistol and from close range, said a Special Investigation Team (SIT) probing the case.While the SIT report suggested that the businessman, Indrakant Tripathi, may have shot himself, the probe team reached the conclusion without interrogating the suspended IPS officer Mani Lal Patidar, who was named as an accused by the family of the businessman. Mr. Patidar, who was suspended as SP Mahoba on charges of corruption and extortion, has not been able to turn up for questioning as he was COVID-19 positive, his lawyer informed the SIT, said ADG Prayagraj Prem Prakash.\"He (Mr. Patidar) has been summoned. We also communicated with his headquarters to contact him. But neither he is taking calls nor is his location traced,\" Mr. Prakash told reporters on Friday.On September 5, in a letter to Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath and in a video shared on social media, Mr. Tripathi had alleged that the officer, Mr. Patidar, was threatening to kill him after he refused to pay him ₹6 lakh per month as extortion sum. Two days later, Mr. Tripathi was found in his luxury car with a bullet wound in his neck. He succumbed to the injury a week later. The Uttar Pradesh government then formed an SIT to probe the matter. The police have said that the evidence collected in the case so far does not point to murder. However, the “circumstances in which the incident took place” are still being investigated, said Mr. Prakash. “From the investigation so far, it has become clear that he was shot from the front, the bullet was fired from inside the car and from close range,” the officer said.Ballistic probe of the seven pistols recovered in the case — four of the accused persons, two of the businessman\\'s partners and one belonging to the businessman himself — showed that he was shot with his own licensed pistol, said Mr. Prakash. The bullet was found lodged in the seat of the car and the pistol was found lying between his feet, added the officer. The SIT did not find any evidence of any other person being at the spot. The investigation also indicated that Mr. Tripathi harboured a “feeling of deep insecurity” and was on the brink of a breakdown after a video showing him gambling went viral on September 8, said the officer. A gambling case had been filed at a local police station in August, and though it did not name Mr. Tripathi, his name was added to the FIR later.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n The COVID-19 outbreak in Gujarat would deprive the people of the State of the famed garba celebrations during the Navaratra festival, as the Gujarat government on Saturday announced that it would not permit any garba event anywhere due to the pandemic. The government said it would also not hold the State-level Navratri Mahotsav this year during the festival period from October 17 to October 25. The decision was taken by Chief Minister Vijay Rupani after a review meeting. In a statement, the government said, “in public interest in view of the pandemic, CM has taken a decision to not allow the garba celebrations and also not hold the State level event at Ahmedabad.” Earlier, State BJP President C.R. Patil also said that no garba festival should be held because it can accelerate the spread of the virus. “It is not possible to maintain social distancing norms and discipline during the garba which attract thousands of people playing in garba in event venues,” a government official said. COVID-19 infections are yet to peak in Gujarat, as the number of cases continues to increase. So far, 3,409 people have officially died of the disease in the State, but according to experts, the actual fatality figure could be substantially higher.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nA Dalit lawyer in Gujarat’s Kutch district was brutally murdered on Friday evening, prompting angry community members to launch protests and block highways. Devji Maheshwari, resident of Rapar town in Kutch and a lawyer with over a decade of practice, was stabbed on his way to his office. He succumbed to his injuries before he could be taken to a nearby hospital.As the word spread about the heinous killing, hundreds of community members in Rapar and other towns in the district blocked highways and burnt scrap tyres. While protests spread, the family members refused to accept the lawyer’s body for cremation and demanded the arrest of those responsible. The family members have named nine persons belonging to an upper caste in the murder. According to sources, the murder was a result of a property dispute, in which Mr. Maheshwari was appearing for a party. Police said Mr. Maheshwari was stabbed while entering his office at Rapar town on Friday evening. A CCTV video showed a youth walking behind the lawyer to his office and running back.“We have detained some people. Very soon we will get to the bottom of the case,” a police official from Kutch told The Hindu. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nDifferences in the West Bengal BJP came to the fore on Saturday over the elevation of Mukul Roy to the post of national vice-president. Mr. Roy, considered one of the founding members of the Trinamool Congress, quit the party in October 2017 and joined the BJP.Mr. Roy was a member of the national executive of the party and his elevation is seen as an attempt to placate him before the 2021 Assembly polls . Over the past few months, speculation was rife about his role and differences with other leaders of the Bengal BJP. Mr. Roy said he along with State party president Dilip Ghosh will ensure the victory for the BJP in the 2021 Assembly polls. However, senior BJP leader and former president of the State unit Rahul Sinha seemed extremely upset with being left out. “I have served the BJP for 40 years. I have been a soldier of the party from its founding days, but now leaders from the TMC are coming and taking our post. There cannot be anything more painful than that,” Mr. Sinha said. The BJP leader did not specify whether he will remain in the party or not but said he will announce his next move in the next 10-12 days. Before Mr. Ghosh was appointed Bengal BJP president in 2015, Mr. Sinha was one of the most important leaders of Bengal. Following Mr. Ghosh’s appointment as Bengal chief, Mr. Sinha was appointed national secretary. The State unit of the BJP has been grappling with the issue of how much importance should the leaders who joined the party defecting from the Trinamool Congress be given. The old party loyalists have been raising concerns over such leaders getting more importance. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nFormer India left-arm spinner Neetu David was appointed the chairperson of the BCCI senior women’s selection committee on Saturday. After inviting applications in January, the BCCI hierarchy did away with the interview process. According to a BCCI insider, the office-bearers preferred to appoint the five members based on their experience in international cricket. “It’s not mandatory to conduct interviews,” he said. Fresh challengesReacting to the news of her appointment, the 43-year-old Neetu said: “It is an honour, but comes with fresh challenges. We will work as per the guidelines of the BCCI and try to come up with the best combination. “I hope to live up to the expectations,” she said. “Well, we have a lot of young talent around and our desire will be to scout and groom them with a long-term perspective with the help of seniors,” Neetu said. “We would like to continue the good work of the previous selection panel.”Asked whether it is the right time for her to don the new role in her career, Neetu, who holds the world record for the best-ever spell of eight for 53 in women’s Test cricket (against England in 1995), said there is nothing like a good or bad time to take up a job. “And, complement that with the desired efforts with integrity and also clarity in your thoughts,” she said.Huge responsibilityThe former India left-arm spinner said the new role was a “huge responsibility.” “I sincerely hope that we live up to the expectations. The biggest challenge will be to see India scale the summit in world cricket.”“Frankly, I see a bright future for women’s cricket in India despite the pandemic. From whatever I have seen in the domestic cricket last season, I am very optimistic,” the North Central Railway officer based in Kanpur said.“It is great to see Mithali (Raj) around as captain. We were teammates and I am one of her biggest fans. We have a lot of mutual respect,” she said.“Being a world-record holder does give that special feeling for me personally. But that is past as a player. Now, I have a different kind of responsibility and I am looking forward to work with my fellow panel members,” she concluded.\\n',\n",

As the spinners came on, even if we are 40 for no loss, it doesn’t matter, I knew me and Shikhar Dhawan could pace our innings after the PowerPlay,” he said.Shreyas was delighted by Capitals’ performance. “As captain, it’s a nice feeling, when you start by winning your first two matches. Now we need to capitalise on the momentum.”The six-day quarantine before the tournament, had been quite challenging, Shreyas said.“The first six days were very challenging, I thought they would pass quickly, but it felt like a month, seriously,” he said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nU.S. President Donald Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court on Saturday, capping a dramatic reshaping of the federal judiciary that will resonate for a generation and that he hopes will provide a needed boost to his reelection effort.Republican senators are already lining up for a swift confirmation of Barrett ahead of the November 3 election, as they aim to lock in conservative gains in the federal judiciary before a potential transition of power. Mr. Trump, meanwhile, is hoping the nomination will serve to galvanise his supporters as he looks to fend off Democrat Joe Biden.An ideological heir to the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, Ms. Barrett would fill the seat vacated after the September 18 death of liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsberg, in what would be the sharpest ideological swing since Clarence Thomas replaced Justice Thurgood Marshall nearly three decades ago. She would be the sixth justice on the nine-member court to be appointed by a Republican president, and the third of Mr. Trump’s first term in office.For Mr. Trump, whose 2016 victory hinged in large part on reluctant support from conservative and white evangelicals on the promise of filling Scalia’s seat with a conservative, the latest nomination in some ways brings his first term full circle. Even before Ginsburg’s death, Mr. Trump was running on having confirmed in excess of 200 federal judges, fulfilling a generational aim of conservative legal activists. \\n\\nAlso Read\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDonald Trump plans to nominate Judge Barrett to US Supreme Court: Reports \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0\"The biggest thing you can do is the appointment of judges, but especially the appointment of Supreme Court justices,” Mr. Trump told supporters on Friday night at a campaign rally in Newport News, Virginia. “It sets the tone of the country for 40 years, 50 years. I mean, a long time.”The announcement came before Ginsburg was buried beside her husband next week at Arlington National Cemetery. On Friday, she was the first woman to lie in state at the Capitol, and mourners flocked to the Supreme Court for two days before that to pay respects.Within hours of Ginsburg’s death, Mr. Trump made clear he would nominate a woman for the seat, and later volunteered he was considering five candidates. But Mr. Barrett was the early favorite, and the only one to meet with Trump.Ms. Barrett has been a judge since 2017, when Mr. Trump nominated her to the Chicago-based 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. But as a longtime University of Notre Dame law professor, she had already established herself as a reliable conservative in the mold of Scalia, for whom she clerked in the late 1990s.She would be the only justice on the current court not to have received her law degree from an Ivy League school. The eight current justices all attended either Harvard or Yale. \\n\\nAlso Read\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJoe Biden blasts Trump’s plan to push Supreme Court nominee ahead of election\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The staunch conservative had become known to Mr. Trump in large part after her bitter 2017 appeals court confirmation on a party-line vote included allegations that Democrats were attacking her Catholic faith. The U.S. President also interviewed her in 2018 for the vacancy created by the retirement of Justice Anthony Kennedy, but Mr. Trump ultimately chose Brett Kavanaugh.Mr. Trump and his political allies are itching for another fight over Ms. Barrett’s faith, seeing it as a political windfall that would backfire on Democrats. Catholic voters in Pennsylvania, in particular, are viewed as a pivotal demographic in the swing state that Mr. Biden, also Catholic, is trying to recapture.While Democrats appear powerless to stop Ms. Barrett’s confirmation in the GOP-controlled Senate, they are seeking to use the process to weaken Mr. Trump’s reelection chances.Ms. Barrett’s nomination could become a reckoning over abortion, an issue that has divided many Americans so bitterly for almost half a century. The idea of overturning or gutting Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 decision that legalised abortion, has animated activists in both parties for decades. Now, with the seemingly decisive shift in the court’s ideological makeup, Democrats hope their voters will turn out in droves because of their frustration with the Barrett pick.Mr. Trump has also increasingly embraced the high court - which he will have had an outsized hand in reshaping -as an insurance policy in a close election. \\n\\nAlso Read\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRuth Bader Ginsburg: a warrior for gender parity \\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Increases in mail, absentee and early voting brought about by the coronavirus pandemic have already led to a flurry of election litigation, and both Mr. Trump and Mr. Biden have assembled armies of lawyers to continue the fight once vote-counting begins. Mr. Trump has been open about tying his push to name a third justice to the court to a potentially drawn-out court fight to determine who will be sworn in on Jan. 20, 2021.\"I think this will end up in the Supreme Court,” Mr. Trump said on Wednesday of the election, adding, “And I think it’s very important that we have nine justices.”Meanwhile, outside conservative groups are planning to spend more than $25 million to support Mr. Trump and his nominee. The Judicial Crisis Network has organised a coalition that includes American First Policies, the Susan B. Anthony List, the Club for Growth and the group Catholic Vote to help confirm Ms. Barrett, and Mr. Trump’s campaign is expected to include the nomination in upcoming advertising.\\n',\n",

He could be playing more matches this time around, though he had missed the first match against Chennai Super Kings, since he was quarantined.

NITI Aayog and the government did not comment. India’s efforts to promote EVs have been stymied by a lack of investment in manufacturing and infrastructure such as charging stations.

       " '\\nWith stakeholders looking up to village and Responsible Tourism (RT) destinations to woo tourists in the wake of the COVID-19 onslaught and subsequent emphasis on hygiene and physical distancing, efforts are on to hew out a tour circuit linking Vaikom, Ambaloor, Valanthakad, Perumbalam, and Kadamakudy. Vaikom has already made waves by being the epicentre of Peoples Participation for Participatory Planning and Empowerment (PEPPER), an RT initiative of the Kerala Tourism. Coincidentally, the theme of World Tourism Day that falls on Monday (September 27) is ‘Tourism and Rural Development’. Even as the world is shifting focus to rural tourism by involving the local community, Kerala has made strides in this regard in the past decade. The slew of global and national recognitions that the State has gained is proof for it, said K. Rupesh Kumar, coordinator, State RT Mission. “RT initiatives have two main advantages. The local community will considerably benefit from tourist footfall, while the ecological impact of tourism will be minimal. Schemes like PEPPER are implemented in a panchayat or island. The local body of each region too is roped in for the purpose, following which a tourism resource mapping is done, to ready a directory of traditional artisans, story tellers, and others with expertise in various fields. Guests can directly contact them sans middlemen. Such experiential tourism packages are becoming a global trend, especially in the wake of the pandemic,” he said.With Vaikom less than an hour’s drive from Kochi, a circuit of emerging RT destinations like Ambaloor, Valanthakad, Perumbalam, and Kadamakudy could be developed, tourism sources said. The rural and RT initiatives launched recently gave a boost to tourism in Ernakulam. Valanthakad island, located a stone’s throw away from Kochi in Maradu Municipality, is the latest to join the list. A bridge is being built to establish connectivity with the mainland, while a walkway, floating facilitation centre, and a boat jetty will be constructed as part of a ₹90-lakh project of the Kerala Tourism. Kadamakudy island is a high-in-demand destination, especially for domestic tourists, while Ambaloor is set to follow suit. Nedumchira near Perumbavoor, Piravom, Thiruvairanikulam, Ashramam Kadavu, and Sivarathri Kadavu have found place in the list of recently-developed destinations in Ernakulam. Furthermore, the Ernakulam District Tourism Promotion Council (DTPC) is spearheading efforts to establish a beach circuit, linking beaches in the Goshree islands. All this is aimed at invigorating rural tourism prospects in the district, DTPC sources said. \\n',\n",

The report, which was prepared after examining the project files and the site itself, finds grave issues in the implementation of the housing scheme, and a vigilance case must be registered against the Mayor, LDF leaders K.J. Antony and V.P. Chandran said in their statement.Appointment of Secretary Meanwhile, Deputy Mayor K.R. Premakumar has written to the Chief Minister, Minister for Local Self-Governments, and other senior government officials, asking for fresh appointments to the posts of Secretary and Additional Secretary at the corporation. For the past 14 months, either the Regional Joint Director (RJD) or the Additional Secretary has often been given additional charge of the Corporation Secretary, and their services are not always available, impacting the regular functioning of the civic body, a release from the Deputy Mayor’s office said.The Secretary who currently holds charge is also the RJD and is required to discharge local body election-related functions. Meanwhile, the Additional Secretary, who is set to retire in about two months and has taken charge temporarily, but without an official appointment, remains unable to sign several files and bills.While the corporation is willing to pay ₹2.5 crore to the contractors who are on strike over non-payment of dues, the cheque has not yet been signed by the Secretary, Mr. Premakumar said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nA person accused of child sexual abuse escaped recently from the first-line treatment centre (FLTC) at the Kochi airport convention centre, throwing light on the challenge facing the police in guarding the arrested who test positive for SARS-COV-2.The infected among those arrested by the police and Excise are put up at the FLTC at Kochi airport along with the other infected members of the public. Though police personnel are put on guard duty at the centre, security remains far from foolproof. “We have taken up the matter with the District Disaster Management Authority, citing that it is really tough to keep a tab on the accused who remain mixed with civilians. A possible solution is a separate FLTC for the arrested. With more among the arrested increasingly testing positive since September, the task is getting progressively difficult,” said K. Karthik, District Police Chief (Ernakulam Rural). While the centre has multiple entry and exit points, police personnel are deployed only at the main entrance, which is more than 100 metres away from the facility. “The accused are not always in the sight of the police guards who have to largely depend on information from health and paramedical staff at the centre. We have already petitioned the District Police Chief and now plan to raise it with the District Collector as well,” said M.V. Sanil, district secretary (Ernakulam Rural), Kerala Police Association.Mr. Karthik said the presence of criminals accused of heinous crimes amid them might be disturbing for civilians at the centre as well.At present, those arrested and remanded by the court are taken to a detention centre being run by the Jail Department at Karukutty near Angamaly. They are then tested for SARS-CoV-2, and those returning negative results are sent to jails, while the ones testing positive are shifted to the FLTC at the Kochi airport. Though security is far better, even the detention centre at Karukutty also remains vulnerable as was exposed by the two successive incidents of escape by an accused from there in as many nights suggest. “Unlike the prison fortified by high walls, the detention centre has no such protective walls, and an accused who manages to give the guards the slip can easily flee or take cover in the thick vegetation outside the centre,” said a police official.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nLondon police clashed with demonstrators on Saturday as they broke up a protest in Trafalgar Square against COVID-19 restrictions amid rising tensions over limits on everyday life as the government tries to stem a sharp rise in infections. Police and protesters were injured when officers moved in after three hours of speeches in front of thousands of people who packed the iconic square in London waving placards opposing mandatory vaccinations, face mask requirements and limits on civil liberties. Nine police officers were injured, including two who required hospital treatment for head injuries. Sixteen persons were arrested for a variety of offences including breaching coronavirus regulations, assaulting a police officer and violent disorder. \"As the crowds began to swell in Trafalgar Square, it became impossible for people to maintain social distancing and keep each other safe,” Metropolitan Police Cmdr. Ade Adelekan said. “Likewise, there appeared to be no efforts by organisers to engage with crowds and keep those assembling safe from transmitting the virus.” Police said they intervened because the demonstrators refused to comply with the very social-distancing rules they were there to protest. Officers removed sound equipment, bottles were thrown and police drew their batons in confrontations with protesters. Several people were seen being led away in handcuffs. The demonstration was held as Parliament prepares to review COVID-19 legislation and the government imposes new restrictions to control the disease. Some lawmakers have criticised the government for implementing the rules without parliamentary approval. Speakers at the rally denied they were conspiracy theorists, arguing they were standing up for freedom of expression and human rights. Dan Astin-Gregory, a leadership trainer, acknowledged the deaths and suffering caused by the pandemic, but said the response to COVID-19 has been out of proportion to the threat caused by the disease. \"We are tired of the fear mongering and the misrepresentation of the facts,” he told the crowd. “We are tired of the restrictions to our freedoms.The government earlier this week ordered a 10 p.m. curfew on bars and restaurants nationwide, along with tougher facemask requirements and increased fines for non-compliance. It has also banned most social gatherings of more than six people, but there is an exemption for protests as long as organisers submit a risk assessment and comply with social distancing rules. Before the demonstration began, police said they would encourage protesters to follow the rules, but they would take enforcement action if protesters failed to comply. As the demonstration began, officers in high-visibility vests and surgical masks were visible around the perimeter of the square but there was no effort to silence speakers or prevent protesters from gathering. The atmosphere turned tense later in the afternoon and officers in soft caps were replaced by others wearing riot helmets and face shields. As some protesters shouted, “You’re part of the tyranny,” others sang, “All you need is love.” Saturday’s demonstration came a week after a similar event during which thousands of people crowded into Trafalgar Square. Police said several officers were hurt during that event when a “small minority” of protesters became violent. Britain has Europe’s worst death toll from the pandemic, with nearly 42,000 confirmed deaths tied to COVID-19. New infections, hospitalisations and deaths have all risen sharply in recent weeks. In addition to the nationwide COVID-19 rules, several jurisdictions have imposed tighter restrictions to control local spikes in the disease. By Monday, about one-quarter of the U.K.’s 65 million people will be living under these heightened restrictions. London, home to almost 9 million people, on Friday was added to the British government’s COVID-19 watchlist as an “area of concern.” That means the U.K. capital also could face new restrictions if infections continue to rise in the city. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe Kudumbashree District Mission has embarked on an ambitious 100-day programme to create at least 2,500 micro enterprises and 5,000 jobs by the end of November.The programme christened ‘Immini Balya Onnu’ is part of the State government’s larger 100-day project to help overcome the economic and livelihood challenges posed by the pandemic. “We have adopted a two-pronged strategy — self-employment and wage-based employment — to help our members and their dependants overcome the crisis. The idea is to set up at least 2,500 micro enterprises at the rate of at least one in each of the 1,830 Area Development Societies [ADS] in the district,” said Rajeena T.M., assistant district mission coordinator, Kudumbashree.Each ADS will be encouraged to create enterprises depending on their capabilities and the local demand for sustainable income with the help of Kudumbashree’s consultants for micro enterprises. At the same time, public sector units, offices, companies, malls, and hospitals will be approached to leverage employment opportunities offered by them. Kudumbashree is already into housekeeping and sanitisation work, and the new campaign will be utilised to push it further across the district.“We have shot off expressions of interest of sorts to various entities, and a few of them have already made enquiries,” said Ms. Rajeena.The district mission also plans to run Community Development Society-level contests as part of the campaign to find out the best CDSs in terms of employment generation. Contests will be held separately for urban and rural-level CDSs considering the differences in opportunities and circumstances.“The top three CDSs creating the most number of sustainable micro enterprises will be awarded cash prizes,” said Ms. Rajeena. The circular from the district mission regarding the programme has already been discussed in detail by CDS chairpersons, accountants, and micro enterprises sub-committee conveners. It will be followed by block-level project review meetings for three days from Sunday during which doubts relating to the project will be clarified. An online meeting of all ADSs will be held on Sunday. The seven-member committees of ADSs have been asked to discuss the project and frame an action plan for its execution. They are supposed to submit the list of potential micro enterprises within their limits to the CDSs concerned, following which training will be imparted to members through the district mission. \\n',\n",

Primary cooperative societies have led the efforts, with over 1,000 acres under them, while public sector institutions like Traco Cables at Irumbanam too have joined the initiative. Places like Keezhillam, Palliyakkal, Varapetty, Vazhakulam, Vadavukode, Vengola, and Vadakkekara have seen large areas being brought under fresh cultivation.R.M. Ramachandran from Keezhillam said 15 acres in the area had been brought under cultivation under the aegis of a primary cooperative, while Palliyakkal near North Paravur, known for its efforts to cultivate paddy and vegetables, has prepared 25 acres to be brought under the cultivation of cold season vegetables like cabbage.Palliaykkal Service Cooperative Bank is leading the efforts, bringing around 65 acres under vegetable cultivation and 220 acres under pokkali rice cultivation. The efforts had been on even before the call for Subhiksha Keralam programme was made.Around 1.5 acres are under cultivation at Traco Cables, Irumbanam, a public sector undertaking.Paddy has been identified as an important crop under the Subhiksha Keralam project. According to Agriculture Department sources, around 560 hectares have been identified for cultivation. Nearly 190 hectares had already been brought under cultivation, and more area is expected to be added in the winter season.Restrictions on movement of people owing to the pandemic are seen as a major opportunity for raising food production, and crops like millets too are being encouraged. Around seven hectares have been brought under millet cultivation in the district.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDefence Minister Rajnath Singh on Saturday said a country that depends on imports for its military equipment can never be strong and asserted that being self-sufficient in the defence sector is linked to “self-respect” and “sovereignty“.India is one of the most lucrative markets for global defence giants and the country has figured among the top three global importers of military hardware for the last eight years.Mr. Singh also mentioned the government’s decision to put restrictions on import of 101 weapon and military platforms, including light combat helicopters, conventional submarines and cruise missiles, under a staggered time-line till 2024.“This single decision has created an opportunity to manufacture defence equipment worth ₹52,000 crore per year in India,” he said at an event.Mr. Singh also said that “a country that depends on imports for its defence equipment can never be strong”. “Therefore, being self-sufficient in the defence sector is very important and it is linked to the ‘self-respect’ and ‘sovereignty’ of our country,” he said.The government’s decision to make India “self-reliant” does not mean that doors are being closed, but signifies that more doors are being opened for companies to do manufacturing in the country, Mr. Singh said.The Indian armed forces are projected to spend around $130 billion in capital procurement in the next five years, according to estimates.The central government will soon bring a new Defence Production and Procurement Policy, he said during the event titled “Deendayal Smriti Vakhyayan”.Bhartiya Jan Sangh co-founder Pandit Deendayal Upadhyay’s 104th birth anniversary was on Friday.“What is the point of importing things that are being manufactured in India or that can be manufactured in India easily? When we would become ‘vocal for local’, we would not only be getting things that can be manufactured in India easily, but we would also be encouraged to manufacture those products that are currently not being made in the country,” Mr. Singh said.Speaking on the farm Bills, which were recently passed by Parliament, the Minister said that the commitment towards welfare of farmers dates back to the days of Deendayal Upadhyay.“No one can deter us from this path. For the first time after Independence, Atalji (former prime minister late Atal Bihari Vajpayee) had made the country’s villages, poor people and farmers the centre of his policies. Now, Modiji (Prime Minister Narendra Modi) is working on the same path and in a big way,” Mr. Singh said.He said that Prime Minister Modi has taken such steps that will help farmers get a better price for their produce.Several Opposition parties, including the Congress, have claimed that the Bills — Farmer’s Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement of Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020 and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020 — will harm the interest of farmers and benefit corporates, a claim denied by the government.The Centre has asserted the Bills will be beneficial for farmers and increase their income.“The farmer of this country is not forced to mortgage his hard work in mandis now. After the passage of these Bills, every farmer of the country will be free to sell his crop anywhere in the country, where he gets a better price,” Mr. Singh said.The Minister also spoke about the three key labour reform Bills which were passed by Parliament on Wednesday“In this country, there were so many laws for the workers that it became almost impossible for the labourers to get their rights. Now, the government has passed the new Labour Bill in Parliament and laid the foundation for new labour reforms in the country,” Mr. Singh said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n The police have cracked the September 20 robbery at a jewellery store at Jalahalli and arrested three men, one of whom had been caught robbing another jeweller but was out on bail. On September 20, two men entered the jewellery store posing as customers and asked for a gold chain one of them had ordered a month ago. They later brandished a pistol, threatened the shopkeeper and made away with 3.45 kg of gold ornaments, over 700 grams of silver articles, and ₹3.96 lakh in cash.The police recovered CCTV camera footage of the incident as well as of August 20 when the accused had placed the order. “We used the footage to develop photographs of the suspects and compared them with photographs of known offenders in jewellery shop robberies. One of the photos of a gang member matched that of an accused in an old case,” said a police officer. Fingerprints collected from the crime scene also matched those of an accused in the old case, Gopa Ram, 28, of Rajasthan. He was earlier working at a jewellery store in Yelahanka and had helped another gang rob it in 2016. He was arrested in the case but had secured bail. Interrogation of the accused in the 2016 case led the police to Gopa Ram. He had returned to Rajasthan briefly after being released on bail, but returned to the city in 2018 and since then had been working as a food delivery partner. He had delivered food to the Jalahalli jewellery store several times in the last few months, observed when the owner used to be alone at the shop and decided to loot it with two of his associates, Jitendra Mali, 31, and Veer Rao, 32, both hailing from Rajasthan and working in the city. The police have recovered 1.75 kg of gold ornaments worth ₹90 lakh and ₹3.5 lakh in cash from them along with an air gun that they had used to threaten the owner.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nBottlenecked junctions that abound in Kochi’s arterial roads must be widened and improved as per Indian Roads Congress (IRC) guidelines in order to streamline vehicle flow in the city, B.G. Sreedevi, former Director of NATPAC, has said. Traffic experts must study each junction and suggest corrective measures to smoothen the traffic flow. The IRC norms speak of the need for adequate space for free left turns and other amenities at junctions. This is a cost-effective measure. Roundabouts can be built in junctions which host traffic beyond a certain limit. Busier junctions need a full-fledged signal system while overbridges must be built at junctions which encounter huge queues of vehicles in different directions, Ms Sreedevi said. Such measures, alongside the impending launch of the ₹27-crore Intelligent Traffic Management System (ITMS) in the city, will considerably benefit motorists. Ban on parking at bellmouths of junctions, at U turns and removal of encroachers will further decongest the city and its immediate suburbs. These measures will also help pedestrians safely cross the road at junctions, she said. Experts had repeatedly flagged patchy development work done to widen junctions. They included ₹50-lakh worth widening work done by the PWD a decade ago at Edapally Junction and a multi-crore work done by KMRL in and around the junction, where two NHs and the NH Bypass converge. While these works smoothened traffic movement on the northern side of the junction, inadequate space utility on the southern side is hampering streamlined flow of vehicles on the free-left turns from Aluva towards NH Bypass and from NH Bypass towards Palarivattom. Similar issues choke traffic movement at Palarivattom Bypass Junction (which too was partly developed as part of constructing the flyover), Kaloor Junction, Kadavanthra Junction and Madhava Pharmacy Junction and almost all junctions on MG Road. They contribute to considerably slowing down traffic movement. \\n',\n",

Of the 200 beds for category B patients at the second-line treatment centre (SLTC) at Adlux, Angamaly, about 160 are occupied now, she said. With the increase in cases, it becomes necessary to prepare to treat COVID-19 patients at taluk hospitals and other major hospitals in the district too, she said. While the Angamaly taluk hospital does not have enough space to set up a COVID-19 ward in separate building, a section of the ground floor with a separate entrance and about 20 beds would be set aside for COVID-19 patients. An attempt is being made to increase the capacity at the Angamaly SLTC to 250 beds, the doctor said.“Besides the Muvattupuzha General Hospital and the Aluva District Hospital, the taluk hospitals at Perumbavoor, Thripunithura, Angamaly, Palluruthy, and Kothamangalam will set up wards. The Fort Kochi taluk hospital will be entirely converted into a COVID-19 hospital with 150 beds for mostly category B patients. With an 18-bed ICU available at the hospital, category C patients could also be treated at the facility,” said Dr. Mathews Numpeli, district programme manager, National Health Mission.Patients in isolationFor now, beds in taluk hospitals are only being set aside for patients in isolation at home who might suddenly require treatment. Only once all other facilities are exhausted will the separate ward at the taluk hospitals be put to use, he said. An order was received from health authorities to set up an exclusive ward for COVID-19 treatment with continuous oxygen supply available for each bed, along with an ICU and ventilator, said a doctor at the Karuvelipady taluk hospital. “We have approached the Kochi Corporation to help set up a separate ward which could have about 40 beds. Additional staff appointments will also have to be made,” the doctor said.Oxygen therapyConsidering oxygen therapy is crucial for category B patients who could be experiencing more severe symptoms, the Muvattupuzha General Hospital is also increasing its oxygen support to set up a COVID-19 ward with about 25 beds, that could begin functioning in about a week, said a doctor at the hospital. The hospital already had an isolation ward where suspected COVID-19 patients were admitted while they awaited test results. The staff from the isolation ward would now handle the new COVID-19 ward, the doctor said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\n After months of wait, the renovated Koyilandy fishing harbour in Kozhikode district will be thrown open to fishers on October 1. Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan will inaugurate the completed project through videoconferencing.The harbour now has improved amenities for safe anchoring of fishing boats. It includes a big hall for auctioning of daily catch, canteen service, comfort stations, spacious parking area, compound wall and entrance gate. Two long breakwaters too have been completed in the area for safe operations.Koyilandy MLA K. Dasan said the development fund sanctioned by both the Union and State governments had been spent for the project. “We have been working for the completion of this project for over 10 years. Responding to the fishers’ plea, it was in 2007 that the work was formally launched,” he said.So far, about ₹68 crore has been allocated for the completion of various development works at the harbour. Some of the major remaining works include the construction of a sewerage treatment plant and the coastal road. Within a few months, Matsyafed will open its fuel bunks in the area for fishing boats.The reclamation of the required extent of land for the auction hall and canteen was the main hurdle for the timely completion of the work. Local fishermen too opposed the reclamation using soil mined from the harbour area.With the delay in completion, the project estimate was revised multiple times since the sanctioning of the work. The project was approved by the Union government as it was expected to benefit about 50,000 people, including fishers, boat owners and allied workers in the district.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nTammy Abraham scored in the third minute of injury time to complete Chelsea’s comeback from three goals down to draw at West Bromwich Albion 3-3 as Thiago Silva had a tough introduction to the English Premier League on Saturday. Chelsea fell 3-0 behind after just 27 minutes and it was partly down to Thiago Silva, who failed to control a simple pass to him allowing Callum Robinson to run through and score West Brom’s second goal. Robinson put the hosts in front after four minutes after another poor piece of defensive work, this time from Marcos Alonso, and Kyle Bartley completed a fast start for West Brom by side-footing in the third when unmarked at a corner.Chelsea staged a stunning recovery, though, with Mason Mount and substitute Callum Hudson-Odoi scoring in the 55th and 70th minutes, respectively. Still, it looked like West Brom was going to hang on for a first win of the season since its promotion, only for Abraham to tap into an empty net after the ball landed at his feet from a save by Sam Johnstone. Chelsea has spent nearly $300 million on new signings and the team has yet to gel, with its defending especially weak at The Hawthorns. Thiago Silva, who made his Chelsea debut in the English League Cup in midweek, was given the armband for the game against West Brom with club captain Azpilicueta starting on the bench. The Brazil center back has been signed to shore up a defense that lacked leadership under Frank Lampard last season but it looked as shaky as ever, with Thiago Silva alongside Andreas Christensen at center back. Alonso, the left back, was hauled off at halftime by a furious-looking Lampard, whose two changes at the break had the impact he desired. One of them, Azpilicueta, laid on Mount to smash a swerving shot into the corner from 25 yards (meters) before the other halftime sub, winger Hudson-Odoi, exchanged a one-two with Kai Havertz and stroked a finish low into the net. Abraham’s late goal ensured Chelsea didn’t lose two straight, having been beaten by Liverpool 2-0 last weekend. Lampard’s team started with a 3-1 win at Brighton. Goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga was dropped for the game after his error in the loss to Liverpool, with Willy Caballero starting instead. Chelsea signed Edouard Mendy from Rennes this week but he wasn’t deemed ready to start.\\n',\n",

       " \"\\nThe story so far: The Comptroller and Auditor General (CAG) of India, in its latest audit report of government accounts, has observed that the Union government withheld in the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI) more than ₹1.1 lakh crore out of the almost ₹2.75 lakh crore collected through various cesses in 2018-19. The CAG found this objectionable since cess collections are supposed to be transferred to specified Reserve Funds that Parliament has approved for each of these levies. The nation’s highest auditor also found that over ₹1.24 lakh crore collected as Cess on Crude Oil over the last decade had not been transferred to the designated Reserve Fund — the Oil Industry Development Board — and had instead been retained in the Centre’s coffers. Similarly, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Compensation Cess was also “short-credited” to the relevant reserve fund to the extent of ₹47,272 crore in two years (₹40,806 crore in 2018-19 and ₹6,466 crore in 2017-18).What is a cess?The Union government is empowered to raise revenue through a gamut of levies, including taxes (both direct and indirect), surcharges, fees and cess. While direct taxes, including income tax, and indirect taxes such as GST are taxes where the revenue received can be spent by the government for any public purpose in any manner it deems appropriate for the nation’s good, a cess is a earmarked tax that is collected for a specific purpose and ought to be spent only for that. Every cess is collected after Parliament has authorised its creation through an enabling legislation that specifies the purpose for which the funds are being raised. Article 270 of the Constitution allows cess to be excluded from the purview of the divisible pool of taxes that the Union government must share with the States.Editorial | Cess pool: On CAG report of Centre's accountsHow many cesses does government levy?A report titled Cesses and Surcharges: Concept, Practice and Reforms since 1944, prepared by the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy in August 2018 and submitted to the Fifteenth Finance Commission listed 42 cesses that have been levied at various points in time since 1944. The very first cess was levied on matches, according to this study. Post Independence, the cess taxes were linked initially to the development of a particular industry, including a salt cess and a tea cess in 1953. Subsequently, the introduction of a cess was motivated by the aim of ensuring labour welfare. Some cesses that exemplified this thrust were the iron ore mines labour welfare cess in 1961, the limestone and dolomite mines labour welfare cess of 1972 and the cine workers welfare cess introduced in 1981. The introduction of the GST in 2017 led to most cesses being done away with and as of August 2018, there were only seven cesses that continued to be levied. These were Cess on Exports, Cess on Crude Oil, Health and Education Cess, Road and Infrastructure Cess, Building and Other Construction Workers Welfare Cess, National Calamity Contingent Duty on Tobacco and Tobacco Products and the GST Compensation Cess. And in February, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman introduced a new cess — a Health Cess of 5% on imported medical devices — in the Finance Bill for 2020-2021. \\n\\nAlso Read\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCAG moots probe over cess accounting dodge\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\xa0Why is the issue in the news currently?The CAG’s finding that the Centre retained ₹47,272 crore of GST compensation cess in the Consolidated Fund instead of crediting it to the GST compensation fund in the very first two years of the implementation of the new indirect tax regime has raised several key questions. For one, most crucially, the express purpose of this particular cess is to help recompense States for the loss of revenue on account of their having joined the GST regime by voluntarily giving up almost all the power to levy local indirect taxes on goods and services. Also, as the Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy report observed, the share of revenue to the Centre’s annual tax kitty from cess had risen to 11.88% of the estimated gross tax receipts in 2018-19, from 6.88% in 2012-13. Given that cess does not need to be a part of the divisible pool of resources, this increasing share of cess in the Union government’s tax receipts has a direct impact on fiscal devolution.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nAn indigenous RT-PCR diagnostic kit has been developed by a start-up incubated at the Indian Institute of Science (IISc.). The test kit, based on reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), has been approved for use in authorised COVID-19 diagnostic labs by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Developed by Equine Biotech, founded by Utpal Tatu, professor in the Department of Biochemistry, IISc., the test using the “Global diagnostic kit” takes about one-and-a-half hours to confirm the presence of SARS-CoV-2 in patient samples, and its run time is shorter compared with the kits available in the industry, according to its founders. The company is currently seeking to licence its new COVID-19 test kit and work with med-tech companies and other industries for mass production, marketing, and distribution of these kits.“Our start-up has been working on testing for coronavirus infections for many years, even before the COVID-19 pandemic started. This experience has helped us engineer the kit for COVID-19,” an IISc. release quoted Prof. Tatu as saying. Mass producedWith COVID-19 becoming a global pandemic, and India climbing up the case chart to number two, ramping up testing in the country is crucial for tracking and controlling the spread of the infectious disease. “India needs home-grown diagnostics kits that can easily be mass produced and made accessible to a larger population. But so far, only a few Indian companies have developed reliable and accurate RT-PCR kits; most of the kits used widely are imported, and therefore expensive,” the release stated.Explaining how RT-PCR works, the IISc. release stated that RNA — the genetic material of SARS-CoV-2 — is transcribed into complementary DNA by a process called reverse transcription, and then amplified. The PCR reaction is monitored in real time with the help of a fluorescent DNA-binding dye. The degree of fluorescence indicates the severity of the infection. The company, which has been working on infectious diseases, including zoonotic diseases, since 30 years, has previously developed diagnostic tests for screening livestock, especially cattle and horses, for blood parasitic diseases such as trypanosomiasis, trichomoniasis, theileriosis, and babesiosis, the release added.\\n',\n",

In fact, it could have been averted if filing of FIR against the accused Naveen, who put out an objectionable social media post against Islam, was not delayed,” he maintained.He alleged that such a delay in filing FIR had made the mob turn its anger at the police. “If it was a communal clash, they would have attacked more houses and people,” he said, while pointing out that only the houses of a few persons related to Naveen had been attacked.He took exception to Home Minister Basavaraj Bommai describing the violence as pre-planned. “It is a clear case of failure of intelligence, the police and the government,” he said. Mr. Siddaramaiah’s stance angered the BJP who indulged in an argument with the Congress members.

       " '\\nThe story so far: U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to nominate Amy Coney Barrett, a 48-year-old circuit judge, to succeed Ruth Bader Ginsburg as justice on the Supreme Court, according to the U.S. media at the time of going to print. Ginsburg died on September 18, at 87. Ms. Barrett is the third justice that Mr. Trump nominates to the Supreme Court.What happens next?The Senate has to confirm her nomination after a hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee. The leadership of the Republican Party, which has a 53-47 majority in the Senate, has said a vote will be scheduled before the U.S. elections on November 3. The current Senate will be alive several weeks after the elections, however.Also read | Joe Biden blasts Donald Trump plan to push Supreme Court nominee ahead of electionWhy is there a controversy?In February 2016, the Republican-majority Senate refused to vote on Barack Obama’s nominee to the Supreme Court, Merrick Garland, arguing that no President should appoint a justice in an election year. The same leadership has now made a U-turn. It now argues that the situation this year is different because the White House and the Senate are both under the same party’s control. Democrats say this is hypocrisy. Democrats also believe the confirmation process will be hurried. Republicans claim there have been faster confirmations in the past.Why do parties seek control of the judiciary?Ginsburg was a liberal icon. The conservatives had a 5-4 majority until now on the nine-member Bench. With a new conservative judge, the balance will tilt conservative 6-3. The U.S. is deeply divided over several questions of justice and liberty that are winding their way to the highest court for adjudication. Appointments are for life and a justice would be able to influence the course of the nation for several decades. There are two contending visions for the judiciary at play for long. The Originalists argue that the meaning of the constitutional text is fixed at the time of its framing. Living constitutionalists says it is a dynamic document. Originalists practise judicial restraint, while the living constitutionalists push the boundaries of judicial activism. One must, however, be aware that this classification is not a neat binary. “In my own judicial career, I’ve written many originalist rulings with so-called ‘liberal’ results,” Neil M. Gorsuch, Mr. Trump’s first nominee to the Supreme Court, writes in his book. Ms. Barrett, a devout Catholic, is an Originalist, and could have conservative views on abortion. Feminists and LGBTQ groups oppose her.How will this affect the presidential election?Mr. Trump had made a public pact with conservative voters who were initially sceptical of him that he would fill the judiciary with their allies, and he has kept this promise in the first term. The new vacancy is likely to be the singular issue for a lot of voters on both sides of the divide. Of the 792 active federal judges in the U.S., a quarter are Mr. Trump’s appointees.Democrats say one Supreme Court appointment was stolen from them during the Obama presidency. They have opened a new debate on expanding the number of justices.The confirmation of the justice has a more immediate political implication, as both parties are gearing up for an intense legal battle over this year’s election outcomes. Mr. Trump and his allies are openly challenging the unprecedented expansion of postal ballots this year. There is a possibility that outcomes in many jurisdictions will not be decided on election day. New rules regarding ballots are bound to generate a volley of election cases. The chances of the Supreme Court picking the winner of the Presidential contest are high this year.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIn a reversal, hours before the Karnataka legislature session came to an end on Saturday night, the Legislative Council defeated the Bill introduced to bring changes to three crucial labour laws.The Industrial Disputes and Certain Other Laws (Karnataka Amendment) Bill, 2020, which the labour unions had opposed, had been passed by the Legislative Assembly earlier.Soon after Labour Minister Shivaram Hebbar moved the Bill for consideration of the House, ruling party member Ayanur Manjunath said the proposed changes in the labour laws are anti-labour and against international labour conventions.Speaking on the changes being brought to the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, raising the threshold limit from 100 to 300 for the industries to seek government permission for closure, layoff or retrenchment, he said: “Industrialists were already misusing the provisions when the threshold was 100. With this amendment, there is threat of government losing control over industries.” He said if thousands of industries misuse this Act, there would be large-scale unemployment.On the proposed changes to Factories Act to increase working hours, Mr. Manjunath said it is “inhuman” and goes against the agreed international labour convention. “Working hours have been fixed considering health and efficiency of the worker,” he said. He, however, supported the Bill considering the current industrial and unemployment conditions.Meanwhile, the Opposition Benches urged the Minister to make provisions to protect labour and reintroduce the Bill, or refer it to the select committee, or withdraw the bill. While the Minister urged the Opposition to pass the Bill, tempers flared and the Opposition demanded division of votes. Congress Chief Whip M. Narayan Swamy tore a copy of the Bill. Senior Congress member B.K. Hariprasad said the Bill has been modelled on Gujarat where unions do not exist.Leader of the House Srinivasa Poojary accused the Opposition of setting a bad precedent by asking for division of votes because the combined Opposition – Congress and JD(S) – had the number on their side in the 75-member Upper House. However, as the Opposition insisted on voting, Chairman K. Prathap Chandra Shetty allowed voting in which the Bill was defeated with 26 voting against and 14 in favour. \\n',\n",

Talking about cervical cancer, Abraham Peedicayil, head of department, Gynaecologic Oncology, Christian Medical College, Vellore, said HPV vaccines had averted 20 deaths for every 1,000 persons vaccinated. “It is a high impact vaccine. It is licensed for those above nine years of age but the ideal time is during the early teens. The vaccine is safe for all ages and no serious side effects have been reported,” he said. He noted that screening for cervical cancer should be done for every five years after the age of 30. “Ovarian cancer is the seventh commonest cancer in women in our country but it is the deadliest of all gynaecological cancers. Unlike uterine cancers that have bleeding, ovarian cancer has vague symptoms, is diagnosed late, and has no early tests,” said Anbu Subbian, consultant — gynaecologic oncologist, KMCH, Coimbatore. She added that some women were prone to higher risk — older age group, family history, obesity, endometriosis, infertility drugs and smoking. “The symptoms are persistent bloating, eating less, feeling fuller, abdominal and/or back pain, trouble with your bladder and bowel... A family history of ovarian, breast, colon or uterine cancer can put you at a higher risk of ovarian cancer. Learn your risks and listen to your body,” Dr. Subbian said. Jaishree Gajaraj, gynaecologic oncologist, Apollo Cancer Institute, said the stigma associated with cancer still existed. “People diagnosed with cancer feel it is a deadly disease, while relatives and friends keep away from patients. That cancer means death is not true,” she said.\\n',\n",

And what is wrong in the person mentioned in the conversation expressing anger against someone collecting money in his father’s name?” he asked.Continuing his attack, he said it was not proper on the part of Mr. Siddaramaiah to level the charges banking on an audio conversation. Angered by this, Mr. Siddaramaiah sought to remind the treasury Benches that it was the responsibility of the government to get a probe done. This triggered an heated exchange of words between the Chief Minister and Mr. Siddaramaiah with both leaders losing their cool. The entire lot of BJP members and Congress members joined the argument by supporting their leaders.When a semblance of order prevailed in the House, Mr. Madhuswamy said Congress the should follow norms such as furnishing documents and taking permission before making such charges.Responding to this, Mr. Siddaramaiah recalled that the BJP had accused the then Minister K.J. George with respect to the death of IAS officer D.K. Ravi though it did not have any evidence.He also read out a WhatsApp chat purported to have taken place between a contractor and a prominent person about payment of bribe for the BDA project.Earlier, Mr. Siddaramaiah raised the issue of an audio conversation through telephone between a certain individual and a TV channel with respect to a ₹666.22 crore housing complex work being executed by the BDA and alleged exchange of bribe. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe Bombay High Court on Friday asked the Union government to decide quickly on its notification prohibiting export of onions and said, “It will be in the interest of justice if export of pending consignments of onion with valid shipping bills are allowed.” A Division Bench of Justices Ujjal Bhuyan and Abhay Ahuja was hearing a petition filed by Horticulture Produce Exporters Association and others through advocate Sujay Kantawalla. They have contended that though their bills were prior to issuance of notification dated September 14, 2020 which prohibited export of onions, they were not being permitted to export. The petition stated, “The containers were illegally kept on hold by the customs authorities, as they were illegally acting upon some information that they had received at around 10 a.m. purportedly informing them some policy changes regarding onion exports were to happen, however no policy decision or notification came up.” Senior advocate Pradeep Jetly appearing for Union of India said, “Those consignments of onions which were loaded prior to issuance of the said notification will be allowed to be exported.” The court said, “It appears that the consignments of the petitioners were with the customs authority prior to issuance of the impugned notification. While we appreciate the decision taken by the authorities to mitigate the hardship of those exporters where consignments were already loaded for export, we believe that it would be in the interest of justice if the same benefit is extended to the goods of the petitioners.” The Bench added that “We expect a decision to be taken expeditiously as admittedly the goods are perishable.” The judges adjourned the matter for September 29.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nChennai Metro Rail is planning to introduce electric autorickshaws to give passengers a ride till their doorstep from its stations.It has been about three weeks since services resumed on the 45 km network in the phase-I project. Initially, there were nearly 10,000 commuters travelling but now the number has risen to 20,000 a day. But this is still lower than the pre-COVID-19 traffic of 1.15 lakh commuters a day. Increasing patronageAccording to officials of Chennai Metro Rail Ltd. (CMRL), the traffic could touch peak levels only next year when most professionals return to offices and educational institutions start functioning as usual. “But we need to gradually start putting back in place facilities to assist passengers to reach their destinations from the stations. So, we have been in talks with a private firm for electric autorickshaws. But this may take some time due to formalities like obtaining permission from the government and registrations,” an official said. Electric autorickshaws are being considered after the contract with a firm that had been running share cars around the stations was terminated some time ago. Contractor issuesOfficials said the contract had to be terminated as they were unhappy with the way the service was operated, and owing to a few other issues. “It is important to bring in as many last mile connectivity options as possible for patronage has to go up. But now, there is an additional responsibility to ensure that there is no crowding in the autorickshaws or share cars,” an official said.For the past week, electric bikes have been available at the Alandur, Thirumangalam and Vadapalani stations. This service may be extended to more stations depending on the response. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nAs the number of coronavirus infections in India and Karnataka continues to soar, the positivity rate among both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases over the last week in the State has been the highest in Bengaluru Rural. Data from the Karnataka State COVID-19 War Room as of September 24 evening shows that the positivity rate among asymptomatic cases in the last seven days since the date of the report in Bengaluru Rural stands at 29.7 — for 2,331 tests conducted and 692 cases. Mysuru had the second highest positivity rate of 26.9 for 7,228 tests and 1,943 cases. Chitradurga, Tumakuru, Hassan, and Shivamogga are among the other districts with higher positivity rates for asymptomatic cases.Bengaluru Urban, which is the largest contributor to the State’s tally with over two lakh cases, has a positivity rate of 13.8 — the same as Udupi and Yadgir. The number of asymptomatic tests for the same period in the State capital was 1,10,425, and positive asymptomatic cases 15,194.The least positivity rates for asymptomatic cases were in Kolar (7.5%), Uttara Kannada (10%), and Bidar (10%). Karnataka’s asymptomatic positivity rate is 14.7.As for symptomatic cases, the positivity rate was highest again in Bengaluru Rural (62.6 — 414 tests and 259 cases), followed by Mysuru (48.4 — 1,110 tests, 537 positives), and Udupi (47.5 — 434 tests and 206 positives). The State’s positivity rate for the same period was 38.2 — for 20,756 tests and 7,925 positives, while Bengaluru Urban’s was 44.3 — 7,215 tests and 3,197 positives. The least positivity rates were in Ramanagaram (3.3), Bagalkot (10.9), and Haveri (19).Responding to questions about the positivity rate, Deputy Commissioner of Bengaluru Rural P.N. Ravindra told The Hindu that a temporary drop in testing numbers was a major factor. “The positivity rate increased as the number of tests had dropped briefly due to some reasons. Health workers were on strike for a few days. In addition, there was no supply of RAT kits for some days. Because of all this, testing numbers had dropped from the earlier 500 to 600 tests a day,” he said.But he said the issues had been resolved. On Saturday, a meeting with various stakeholders had resulted in an action plan for the district as well. “We also received 10,000 RAT kits on Friday. Sunday onwards, testing will be ramped up, including for targeted and vulnerable groups. In two to three days, positivity rate should come down,” he added.On the other hand, BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad said increased testing had decreased the positivity rates in the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) limits. “The BBMP is making consistent efforts to increase the testing rates and follow syndromic approach (ILI surveys ) to detect areas of transmission. As a result of this, test positivity is decreasing. However, we can’t be complacent as other areas are seeing surge in cases,” he said. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nTwo women — A. Shanmugathai, 50, and S. Shanthi, 45 — were hacked to death by unidentified assailants, who hurled petrol bombs on them before attacking them with sharp weapons, at Marugalkurichi, under the Nanguneri police station limits, on Saturday. The severed head of Shanmugathai was found a few metres away in the village. The police suspect that the murders could be revenge for a double murder reported in March. Superintendent of Police, Tirunelveli district, N. Manivannan, who inspected the scene of crime, said that special teams had been formed to nab the accused. This is the fifth murder between two rival groups of the same village ever since one Nambirajan eloped with T. Vanmathi, 18, of the locality last year. Vanmathi’s brother, Chellasamy and his accomplices were arrested for beheading Nambirajan in November 2019 in the Tirunelveli city police limits. In retaliation, two relatives of Vanmathi — Arumugam, who runs a small eatery in the village, and Suresh — were hacked to death in March. Held for murder Nambirajan’s parents Arunachalam and Shanmugathai, their sons Ramaiah and Sankar and their relatives, including Esakkipandi, were arrested in connection with the double murder. While Shanmugathai had come out on bail earlier, a few of the accused came out of jail only three days ago. “We chased them out of the village anticipating trouble,” the SP said. The gang, which came in search of the male accused, beheaded Shanmugathai as her sons were not present in the house. Similarly, they also went to the house of Esakkipandi, another accused in the double murder. Since, he was not there, the gang inflicted multiple cut injuries on his mother, Shanthi, 45, leaving her dead on the spot. The police have recovered some weapons, including petrol bombs. A minor girl, Selvi, 14, who was in the house, sustained minor injuries in the melee, the police said. \\n',\n",

This year, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the revision is happening in October. Otherwise, it would have been effected from July,” an official explained. The toll will be increased by 10%. Cars will now have to pay ₹30 for a single trip, instead of the earlier ₹27. For a round trip, cars will pay ₹60. Light commercial vehicles will have to pay ₹78 (single) and ₹154 (round trip) while trucks will be charged ₹117 (single) and ₹220 (round trip).Normally, the road would witness around 1 lakh vehicles a day and a large percentage of them were two-wheelers. The TNRDC had issued around 25,000 local resident passes (LRP). Since the road had joined the nation-wide FASTag network, residents with LRP passes have been asked to get their passes linked with FASTag cards. “This will allow them to enter FASTag lanes without any cash being deducted in any of the five plazas on Rajiv Gandhi Salai,” an official said. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe Bombay High Court on Saturday asked the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) if it has made any arrangements for its differently-abled staff to travel to work during the lockdown.A Bench of Chief Justice Dipankar Datta and Justice G.S. Kulkarni was hearing a public interest litigation filed by the National Association for the Blind over the BMC not paying its 268 visually-impaired employees full salaries during the lockdown.As per the plea filed through advocate Uday Warunjikar, the BMC initially exempted its differently-abled staff members from reporting to work during the lockdown. On May 21, the BMC issued a circular informing such employees that they were entitled to a special leave without loss of pay. However, on May 26, it issued another circular saying that the leave was not special, but a “permissible leave,” which involved a loss of pay for the days that the employees failed to show up for work.As per the May 26 circular, persons with disabilities will not be exempted from reporting to work. They can, however, seek permissible leave. As per the plea, such permissible leave needs to be sanctioned by senior authorities, and for the days that such leave is not sanctioned, an employee has to undergo a loss of pay.Mr. Warunjikar argued that the permissible leave rule was depriving the physically disabled, particularly the visually impaired, of their salaries as they were unable to commute to work. “In the current scenario, people do not even shake hands with anyone. The visually impaired need help to cross a traffic junction, to take trains, to do anything else. No one is there to hold their hands or help them commute. How will they reach their place of work?” Mr. Warunjikar said.He also said there existed a Central government resolution that any differently-abled government staffer must not be deprived of his or her pay on account of failure to report to work during the lockdown. While the disabled employees were paid in full between March 23 and May 31 this year, in the subsequent months, the BMC began to make deductions for the days they missed work, the petitioner said.The BMC, however, claimed before the HC that it took “very good care” of its disabled staff. It said around 1,150 differently-abled staff, including the 268 visually-impaired workers,and had started bus services for them. They were also permitted to use local train services in the city, the BMC said. However, the BMC was not bound by the Central government’s circular, it said.Irked over the reply, the high court asked the civic body that if the Central government’s resolutions did not bind the BMC then why did the latter implement some circulars, and not others. “Why are you then not asking 100% staff members to attend work? Why are you calling them in shifts and asking only for 75% attendance? Why are you not allowing visitors to meet your officers inside their offices during the pandemic?” the bench asked.‘Unfortunate stand’“You can’t say some resolutions of the Central government apply to you while others do not,” the Bench said. The court then asked the BMC to file an affidavit on the travel arrangements it had made for its differently-abled employees. “We are so fortunate that we can see. That we have all limbs and we can move around as we wish to...It is so unfortunate that the corporation has taken this stand,” the Bench said.The court concluded all arguments and reserved its verdict on the plea.(With PTI inputs) \\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe story so far: Farmers have taken to the streets, protesting against three Bills on agriculture market reforms that were passed by Parliament last week and will become laws once they are signed by the President. In Punjab and Haryana, bandhs were observed, with blocked roads and mass rallies. Opposition parties and farmers groups across the political spectrum have expressed concern that the laws could corporatise agriculture, threaten the current mandi network and State revenues and dilute the system of government procurement at guaranteed prices.What are the three Bills?The Bills which aim to change the way agricultural produce is marketed, sold and stored across the country were initially issued in the form of ordinances in June. They were then passed by voice-vote in both the Lok Sabha and the Rajya Sabha during the delayed monsoon session this month, despite vociferous Opposition protest. The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill, 2020, allows farmers to sell their harvest outside the notified Agricultural Produce Market Committee (APMC) mandis without paying any State taxes or fees. The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill, 2020, facilitates contract farming and direct marketing. The Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill, 2020, deregulates the production, storage, movement and sale of several major foodstuffs, including cereals, pulses, edible oils and onion, except in the case of extraordinary circumstances. The government hopes the new laws will provide farmers with more choice, with competition leading to better prices, as well as ushering in a surge of private investment in agricultural marketing, processing and infrastructure.Comment | Will the farm bills benefit farmers?Will farmers get minimum support price?Most of the slogans at the farmers’ protests revolve around the need to protect MSPs, or minimum support prices, which they feel are threatened by the new laws. These are the pre-set rates at which the Central government purchases produce from farmers, regardless of market rates, and are declared for 23 crops at the beginning of each sowing season. However, the Centre only purchases paddy, wheat and select pulses in large quantities, and only 6% of farmers actually sell their crops at MSP rates, according to the 2015 Shanta Kumar Committee’s report using National Sample Survey data. None of the laws directly impinges upon the MSP regime. However, most government procurement centres in Punjab, Haryana and a few other States are located within the notified APMC mandis. Farmers fear that encouraging tax-free private trade outside the APMC mandis will make these notified markets unviable, which could lead to a reduction in government procurement itself. Farmers are also demanding that MSPs be made universal, within mandis and outside, so that all buyers — government or private — will have to use these rates as a floor price below which sales cannot be made.Ground Zero | Farm Bills leave farmers, commission agents and workers worriedWhy are protests vociferous in some States?More than half of all government procurement of wheat and paddy in the last five years has taken place in Punjab and Haryana, according to Agriculture Ministry data. More than 85% of wheat and paddy grown in Punjab, and 75% in Haryana, is bought by the government at MSP rates. Farmers in these States fear that without MSPs, market prices will fall. These States are also most invested in the APMC system, with a strong mandi network, a well-oiled system of arthiyas or commission agents facilitating procurement, and link roads connecting most villages to the notified markets and allowing farmers to easily bring their produce for procurement. The Punjab government charges a 6% mandi tax (along with a 2.5% fee for handling central procurement) and earns an annual revenue of about ₹3,500 crore from these charges.Also read | Farmers in Punjab and Haryana fear end of MSP regimeWhat are some other concerns?One of the major concerns raised by regional political parties and non-BJP State governments is that agriculture falls in the State list, arguing that the Centre should not be making legislation on this subject at all. They are concerned about the loss of revenue from mandi taxes and fees, which currently range from 8.5% in Punjab to less than 1% in some States.Some economists and activists say both Punjab and Rajasthan are considering legal measures to expand the bounds of their APMC mandi yards to ensure that they can continue collecting taxes on all agricultural trade within their State’s borders. States such as Chhattisgarh and Odisha have only seen procurement increase over the last five years, after the implementation of decentralised procurement. Paddy farming has received a major boost with procurement at MSPs and farmers fear their newly assured incomes are at stake. \\n\\n\\n\\nWatch | Why are the agriculture bills being opposed?\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nfunction getPlayerID(isSubscribed){\\nif(isSubscribed){\\nreturn \"lUyqynWW\";\\n}\\nreturn \"HxxKTB2U\";\\n}\\nuserIdentify.then(function() {\\tloadAsyncURL(\"https://media.thehindu.com/players/3P8t8GJA-\"+getPlayerID(!isNonSubcribedUser())+\".js\");\\t});\\n\\n\\n\\xa0The majority of agricultural marketing already happens outside the mandi network, with only 7,000 APMC markets operating across the country. Bihar, Kerala and Manipur do not follow the APMC system at all. However, most private buyers are currently small traders at local mandis. The removal of stock limits and facilitation of bulk purchase and storage through the amendment to the Essential Commodities Act could bring large corporate players into the agriculture space. Although they will bring much-needed investment, they could also skew the playing field, with small farmers unlikely to match them in bargaining power.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe Anti-Bank Fraud Wing of the Central Crime Branch (CCB) on Saturday unearthed a fake job portal and arrested three persons for allegedly duping people in the guise of providing jobs amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The police said the accused had created a fake job portal, which was similar to a leading job portal, and reached out to job-seekers through various modes. Recently, the CCB received a complaint about the portal duping a person, who lost his job owing to the COVID-19 lockdown.The police said Sivasankar, 28, of Velachery, is an engineering graduate and had lost his job recently. Searching for a new job, he posted his profile on the website and deposited ₹3,000 initially towards registration. As he did not get any offer, he called up the numbers provided on the website. The person who received his call asked him to pay ₹8,000 so that he could get a job in a foreign country. The scammers made him transfer up to ₹1.45 lakh to their account towards “processing fee”. As he did not get any job, he lodged an online complaint with the CCB. A special team of the Anti-Bank Fraud Wing took up the investigation that led to a gang operating from New Delhi. The team summoned A. Arif Khan, 31, Wajid Khan, 29, and Sandeep Kumar, 24, to the city and arrested them. They were remanded in judicial custody. A special team is also on the lookout for the suspects behind the fraud. The police said the gang had cheated several job-seekers during the recent slump in the job market. An officer said the gang would target job-seekers and make them pay a processing fee, running into several lakhs, in their Paytm accounts and then go off the radar. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nA group of teachers at the government school in Elambalur in Perambalur district has made sure that 44 students, including two in Class XI, attend online classes by providing them with mobile phones and SIM cards.The joint initiative of four teachers was the brainchild of K. Bairavi, a mathematics teacher, who found that students were not responding to messages sent by the school. “When the government asked us to begin online classes, none of the phone numbers furnished by students was active. Of the 16 students in English medium and 26 in Tamil medium in Class X, only two replied to our messages,” said Ms. Bairavi. The teachers then went from door to door and learnt that the phone numbers pertained to devices of their parents. Ms. Bairavi consulted her family about the idea of buying phones and SIM cards for students. She realised that Class 10 students were worried that with no Internet access, they could lose an academic year. Ms. Bairavi’s daughter urged her to buy phones for all her students. At the cost of ₹1 lakh, 16 students of the English medium received phones with active Internet connections. Inspired by her, other teachers in the school — R. Selvaraj and S. Suresh — along with Perambalur MLA R. Tamilselvan, who heads the Parent-Teachers Association, and the headmistress of a private school, too, agreed to donate mobile phones. “We got two donors from Qatar, who were willing to help the students,” Mr. Selvaraj said.Forty four handsets were purchased, two of which were given to two Class 11 students who performed well in Class 10. “I have decided to take the expenses of recharging the phones on a monthly-basis. It will cost ₹4,000, but it will ensure that my children learn,” she said.Ms. Bairavi received tremendous response on posting about the need for donations on social media. “We did not expect such an overwhelming response. I requested the prospective donors to help the children who live near their houses to attend school in any small way possible,” she added.\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nWe might have over 200 natural satellites in the solar system, but our own moon is rather special to us. And it has to be, for it is the only one our Earth has. Naturally then, it has been studied extensively – probably only next to the Earth itself among celestial bodies. While the space race between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the second half of the 20th Century probably saw the most funds being spent in a single window towards moon missions, it wasn’t the be all and end all. There have been several missions since then, and there will be many more as well, that will have our moon as its target. Its position – both in terms of importance and in terms of space – make it an ideal destination for testing out new technologies as well.Missions of all scalesThe ESA prides itself in having a science programme that encompasses missions of all scales and sizes. The SMART – short for Small Missions for Advanced Research in Technology – programme was envisioned to cater to small relatively low-cast missions. One such mission that looked to test solar-electric propulsion and other deep space technologies was launched on September 27, 2003. Its destination, as you might have rightly guessed, was the moon.With a French-built Hall effect thruster derived from a Russian ion propulsion system, SMART-1 was European in almost every sense, even before it became the first European spacecraft to enter orbit around the moon. The thruster, which used a xenon propellant, generated just enough thrust – comparable to the weight of a postcard. Solar arrays powered the engine which generated the power needed for the ion engines. Slowly expanding orbitFollowing its launch, it was put in a geostationary transfer orbit. From here, SMART-1 used its electric propulsion system for a hugely efficient mission profile. Spinning slowly, the spacecraft moved onto higher and higher elliptical orbits. With mission controllers in Darmstadt, Germany forcing calculated, repeated burns of the ion engine, the spacecraft’s spiral orbit expanded step by step. When SMART-1 was around 2,00,000 km out from Earth, the influence of the moon's gravity started increasing. By November 2004, the spacecraft had reached a point where the moon’s gravitational force was dominant.Closer views, better data The ion engines were still fired gradually, even after SMART-1 attained a polar orbit around the moon. This allowed the spacecraft to now decrease the orbit and hence achieve significantly better and closer views of the lunar surface. During its time orbiting the moon, SMART-1 improved on data returned from various previous missions to the moon. It studied lunar topography, learnt more about the moon’s surface texture and also mapped the minerals’ surface distribution. Mission extendedEven though the mission was designed to end in August 2005, it was extended further with new plans for a lunar impact in 2006. Having exhausted the propellant, the spacecraft’s ion engine was fired one last time in September 2005, after which it was in a natural orbit based on the gravitational effects of the moon, Earth and sun, with occasional altitude control. SMART-1’s ion engine had fired for over 4,900 hours, a record at that time for an engine of this type. As per the revised plan, the spacecraft crashed onto the moon’s surface on September 3, 2006. Earth-based telescopes observed the impact, which produced a dust cloud. The near three-year existence of SMART-1 not only confirmed technical competence, but also provided valuable scientific insights about our moon.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nPetroleum dealers and oil marketing companies (OMCs) in the State are concerned over the sale of a spurious product in the name of biodiesel to truckers. The product is being sold ₹15 cheaper than the price of regular diesel, said oil industry sources. “Our fuel outlets are not involved in this sale. Imported biofuel is being blended with diesel and some chemical and they are selling them in bulk to fleet owners using tankers. In the long run, this product corrodes the engine and leads to the vehicle being discarded,” said a dealer in Erode district.‘Business hit’Dealers said that Thoothukudi, Salem, Erode, Madurai, Tirunelveli and even Chennai and Tiruvallur were witnessing sale of such spurious fuel, which was affecting their business. An official in Thoothukudi confirmed that there were sellers of such spurious fuel, and action would be taken soon. “One dealer in Tiruvallur lost around 60 KL because of it. When price of diesel goes up in neighbouring Andhra Pradesh, we usually see a hike in sales in bordering areas. But that is not there now. Instead, bulk customers have just moved to buying this fuel and are tanking up on it to save money,” said another dealer. An oil industry expert said this was a pan-India issue. “Dealers in Gujarat have said they would stop purchase this month-end if the government and oil marketing companies do not take steps to curb the menace. Also, imagine the cost to the environment. At a time when the country has switched over to the cleaner BS-VI fuel, this could prove detrimental to the whole exercise,” he pointed out. Detailed probe soughtK.P. Murali, president, Tamil Nadu Petroleum Dealers Association, urged the Centre to order a CBI inquiry into the issue. “We had sought the assistance of the State government and in some districts, the Revenue Department swung into action and has arrested a few people. We need a thorough investigation into the matter,” he said. Indian Oil Corporation Executive Director (Tamil Nadu) and State Level Oil Industry coordinator P. Jayadevan said the industry had taken up the issue with the State government and raids had been conducted and vehicles seized. The Ministry had also written to the State government, he added.\\n',\n",

In the absence of councillors, it is their job to liaison with residents through regular meetings and ensure that grievances are addressed. Activists including Kathyayini Chamaraj, who was a member of Shanthinagar Ward Committee, raised questions on the composition of the new committees and how people could participate in them. Mr. Prasad said officers had been directed to hold at least two meetings a month. “Anybody can participate in the meetings. They will be held virtually and the nodal officer is expected to be at the ward office at the time so that those who cannot join virtually can come to the office,” he said.Epidemiologist Giridhar R.

       " '\\nCourts cannot injunct an Advisory Board from considering premature release of convicts just because victims of crime insist on giving them a personal/oral hearing to oppose the release on the ground of threat to their lives if the convicts were let free, the Madras High Court has held. Chief Justice Amreshwar Pratap Sahi and Justice Senthilkumar Ramamoorthy said personal/oral hearing had neither been explicitly contemplated nor it could be read into the rules relating to premature release. Hence, it would be sufficient if written representations were considered. The first Division Bench vacated an interim injunction granted by another Bench on February 6, 2019, restraining the Advisory Board in Puducherry from considering the premature release of life convicts Venkatesh alias Dhanasekar, Sathish, Narayanan, Madhan and Sankar alias Jai Shankar. The convicts were part of a 16-member gang which had hurled countrymade bombs on the Mudaliarpet police station campus in the Union Territory in broad daylight and murdered a rival gang member Kumar alias J. Jayakumar, besides injuring two constables in 2004. Subsequently, an attempt was made to kill Jayakumar’s brothers, Thulasi alias J. Iyappan and J. Manikandan, by hurling bombs but the duo escaped, leading to registration of a case for attempt to murder. In another attempt, the trio’s father, Subbu alias Jayaraman, got killed in 2009. An eyewitness to Jayakumar’s death was also done to death in 2010. Citing all these instances, Jayakumar’s mother J. Dhanasekari and brothers Iyappan and Manikandan feared they would also be killed if the life convicts were released prematurely. The woman and her two sons insisted that they must be given an opportunity for personal/oral hearing before the Advisory Board to oppose the release. Rejecting their plea, the Chief Justice said: “In order to claim a right of hearing, one may have to demonstrate prejudice or likelihood thereof.” The scales of opportunity to be offered to the convict and the victim have to be evenly balanced. When convicts have no right to seek a personal/oral hearing before the Advisory Board, such an opportunity could not be given to victims of crime too, the first Bench added. “The remission to be considered is a discretion to be exercised as per some settled parameters and not as a routine exercise… This consideration is not akin to adversarial proceedings where the presence of two or more sides may require a dialogue or a hearing,” the court said. The judges closed the case with the hope and trust that the Advisory Board would take into consideration all materials, including the written objections made by the victim family, before arriving at an objective conclusion on releasing the life convicts. \\n',\n",

About 70% of wholesalers vacated their shops at the Thirumazhisai market by Saturday afternoon. They noted that 80% produce was sold as Sunday was declared a holiday. Sheds put up at the temporary market will be dismantled, and final preparations are under way at Koyambedu. Retail prices of vegetables are likely to drop by 10%-20% as 200 wholesale shops would operate at Koyambedu from Monday, said traders. However, several precautionary measures have been put in place to restrict crowds. The market will not function on Fridays to enable maintenance work. Vehicles bringing produce will be allowed between 9 p.m. and 5 a.m. from Sunday. Monday onwards, only retailers’ vehicles will be permitted to enter till 9 a.m. Passenger autos and two-wheelers have been banned from entering the premises, according to the Chennai Metropolitan Development Authority.

Chandran, a trader, said wholesale shops and those who sell curry leaves and lemons had been permitted to trade. “We expect less crowd as business will be allowed only in shops and not in public spaces or on the streets. We have been instructed to have thermometers, oximeters and hand sanitisers in each shop,” he said. With the reopening of shops in Koyambedu, merchants said retailers would be able to make up for their losses. D. Rajasekaran, president, Federation of All Traders’ Association of Koyambedu Wholesale Market Complex, said, “Wastage and loss will be reduced, and consumers will get fresh produce. Some vegetables like lettuce, broccoli and spring onions will now be available.”About 10,000 visitors and 2,000 retailers’ vehicles are expected to come to the market daily. Only workers in specific uniforms will be allowed. Face masks and physical distancing were mandatory, Mr. Rajasekaran said. While the CMDA has listed out several restrictions, public health experts have called for sustaining the precautionary measures. Precautionary measuresPrabhdeep Kaur, Scientist E/Deputy Director, Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology, said measures should be taken to keep the marketplace more open, with fewer closed areas or small enclosures. “A fever camp should be stationed. Vendors and workers should be registered with details of names, address and phone numbers so that contact tracing is possible when required,” she said.Vendors and workers should be periodically tested so that signs of transmission could be picked up early, Ms. Kaur added.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe Navi Mumbai Police’s cyber cell has busted a phishing gang that operated from Jharkhand.Roopanjali Barua (72) filed a complaint with the Kharghar police on June 6. She said she had trouble using the Dmart app and called a customer care number she found online. The number belonged to the gang and they transferred ₹1.08 lakh from her account after obtaining her bank account details and OTP number. “The gang’s bank account was traced to Kunjbona in Jharkhand, with transactions of ₹4.5 crore in nine months,” Deputy Commissioner of Police, Crime Branch, Pravin Patil, said. A team headed by assistant police inspector Vishal Mane went to Jharkhand and nabbed Sakel Aajam Aayub Ansari (20). The team seized five point of sale (POS) machines, one fingerprint access device, three mobile phones, two registers, 35 debit cards, 15 swipe machines and ₹1.54 lakh in cash. The team said the gang leader, Irshad Ansari (21), is in the custody of the Jharkhand Police in a robbery case. He and three accomplices put up their number online and targeted people.“Sakel ran a shop in Kunjbona where he converted e-wallet money into cash and kept around 2% as commission. Irshad transferred money to Sakel’s e-wallet or bank account and then took the cash from him,” Mr. Mane said. The team is waiting to get the custody of Irshad from the Jharkhand Police.The team also nabbed Ajay Verma (44), an accused in another cyber crime, from Devghar in Jharkhand. Mr. Verma cheated another Kharghar resident by posing as a customer care officer from ICICI bank. “Any person looking for a customer care number should go the authentic website,” Mr. Patil said.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nIf the Bruhat Bengaluru Mahanagara Palike (BBMP) gets its way, citizens will find themselves forking out ₹1,000 as way of fines for not wearing masks and failing to cover their mouth and nose in public. At present, citizens have to pay ₹200, but the civic body has proposed that the State government increase the amount. BBMP Commissioner N. Manjunath Prasad, while holding a videoconference on Saturday said the question of fines was raised at a recent meeting with the Chief Secretary. “The decision has to be taken at the government level,” Mr. Prasad said, while reiterating that wearing masks and keeping a distance from others in public spaces was the most effective way of reducing the risk of exposure to COVID-19.In the first week of May, when masks were made mandatory in the city, a notification was issued by the then civic chief saying that people not wearing masks would be fined ₹1,000 for the first violation and ₹2,000 for subsequent violations. However, the notification was revised after a few days and the fine amount was brought down to ₹200 from ₹1,000.Public outrage was one of the reasons for the revision. Many people told The Hindu after the meeting that such a huge fine would be counterproductive, and would encourage corruption. Some civic officials also held a similar view. “Most people don’t carry ₹1,000 on them,” said a resident.N.S. Mukunda, founder-chairman of the Citizen Action Forum, agreed that there was a need to fine people more heavily. He argued against a five-fold increase of the existing penalty. “A ₹300 to ₹400 fine, backed up with a continuous and sustained awareness campaign will yield results,” he said. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nIs it possible to clap with one hand? Asked my one-time neighbour when I ran into him the other day. I was puzzled by this enigmatic question. He explained. His daughter working in China is in love with her Chinese colleague. They decided to get married. Fortunately, they had the blessings of their respective parents. The girl’s parents proposed that the wedding be held in their hometown in 24 Parganas district — a proposal favourably regarded by the boy’s. All this happened last year when many in China and almost everybody in the outside world were unaware that the scourge of coronavirus would spread from Wuhan.However, when the boy and his parents sought permission to leave for India for the wedding, the Chinese authorities refused to give them consent. Alas, you can’t have a unilateral marriage. And now that the entire world is staring at the pandemic, the poor lovers wouldn’t know when the wedding bells will ring for them.As was expected, news about the virus spreading out of China prompted people to take safety measures. Earlier masks were easy to come by. You landed them as swimmingly as you bought a loaf of bread. But in the changed scenario, masks sell like hotcakes. For those who venture out for essentials, putting on masks have become second nature these days. And scarcely would you see people whose faces haven’t vanished into masks.Year after year, we close relatives celebrate Vishu and Onam by getting together to partake of the feast. After the feast, we would engage ourselves in chitchatting and laughing. However, this year, COVID-19 has played spoilsport, forcing all of us to confine to our own houses. Yet, after the feast at our respective houses, we got together virtually, talked and played, cocking a snook at the virus!We have three weapons in our quiver to keep the virus at bay: wearing mask, washing hands with soap and social distancing. They have become an oft-repeated mantra now.We know masking, hand washing and social distancing are only a temporary step. So, finding a vaccine has become the holy grail of medical researchers. Their optimism gives us hope for seeing safer days soon!Dale Carnegie’s words are apt here: “Most of the important things in the world have been accomplished by people who have kept on trying when there seemed to be no hope at all.”cvsuku@gmail.com \\n',\n",

       " '\\nDMK president M.K. Stalin on Saturday urged Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami to take utmost care to ensure the safety of students of Classes X to XII and teachers who would attend schools (on a voluntary basis) from October 1.He said the government could not afford to remain indifferent on the ground that the students were in the classes with the consent of their parents.In a statement, he said after announcing its decision to open schools for the students of Classes X, XI and XII, the statement of the School Education Minister that the Health Minister would decide on allowing teachers above 50 years to attend schools had caused confusion among parents and teachers.“It gives an impression that the government has not taken seriously the safety of students. The announcement that students would be offered only guidance and they should bring a letter of consent from the parents exposed the government’s motive to pass the buck,” he alleged.Mr. Stalin said there was a doubt that the School Education Minister was not aware of the government order to reopen the schools.“His argument that the Health Minister would decide on who among the teachers should be involved and the Chief Minister would finalise the decision on reducing the syllabus was a clear indication of lack of coordination among various departments,” the DMK leader said.GST compensation In another statement, Mr. Stalin on Saturday said it was highly condemnable that Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami had not raised his voice against the Centre, which had used ₹47,272 crore meant for compensating States affected by the implementation of the GST.“The Chief Minister is maintaining silence even after the CAG, in its report, had pointed out about the use of the compensation cess for other purposes,” he said in the statement.Mr. Stalin said the State governments had agreed to GST amendments since the Centre made a sovereign guarantee and subsequently adopted it in their Assemblies. “When Tamil Nadu decided to adopt a resolution, I suggested it be sent to a select committee. But the government claimed that it had the guarantee from the Centre. Now, the BJP government has thrown to the winds its promise.” He said no Central government in the past had committed an act that would fully dilute the federal structure of the country and financial autonomy of the State governments.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nI was seven years old when I stole my first book from the class library. I wonder if it was the thrill of stealing or the fear of returning the book past its due date. I did not have the money to pay the fine and so, lying seemed like the right decision. Later that year though, my brother got me the same book, Sarojini Pritam’s Laut Ke Buddhu Ghar Ko Aye. Over the years, I lost both copies and recently, when I tried to find the book online, I realised it is out of print. If the library of my childhood had been run without late fee charges, I would have returned the book. And if I had been allowed to do that then, today I would perhaps be able to revisit a cherished childhood memory.The ghost of late fee charges and membership fees remained with me for a long time. Some books got lost, some were returned late. The ghost created an indescribable gap between the world of reading and me. Every time I tried bridging the gap and entering the world of words and stories, the ghost made sure it was farther out of reach. I come from a family which did not set much store by reading. The access to books I had while growing up was through the school library. Or rather, a room which had books stored in cupboards and shelves, some locked, and where silence was the expected bribe in order to get to read.Our school libraries often do not create a space that welcomes thinking along with reading. They are just like dungeons that make reading an isolated. silent and insular activity. When in fact, it is a dynamic act of thinking, discussing, and reflecting.The importance of an inclusive, accessible library struck me when I started teaching in a government school in Delhi two years ago. Most of my students could not access storybooks and literature beyond their course books. While this might seem like a simple enough problem, it reeks of an age-old class and caste divide. We have made intellectual spaces so exclusive and inward-looking that claiming these spaces seems impossible for many a child and an adult.It is a myth that children do not want to read, and that reading is only a leisure activity. The denial of such interactive spaces as a library is a matter that should concern us all, because reading as a leisure activity is also a political act. It leads to critical thinking and questioning the structures that exclude and deprive the most marginalised among us. A lot of schools today do not have a proper library. And if they do, the weekly ‘library period’ is seen as an extracurricular activity when it should be considered an integral part of one’s learning and growth.The school I taught in had a cupboard meant to function as a library. Most of the students in school were oblivious of its existence or even of the word . The library cupboard’s Hindi titles lacked any readers. Some colleagues and I thus decided to build a school library that could function as a community library, only to find ourselves at a loss. What does it mean to build a community library? What sort of a library do we want to build for our students? Certainly not the libraries we grew up with, everyone agreed.But is it possible to create a library without a strict librarian? Can a library function without a code of conduct? It was these questions in 2018 that led me to a library that realises the full potential and limitless possibilities of its space. It is a library that regards its readers more than its books. It is a library that understands that books mean nothing in isolation; books create meaning when they have readers.The Community Library Project (TCLP) charges no membership or late fee. You do not need an ID card or address proof for enrolment. The project brings life to its tagline: “Reading is thinking”. Thousands of its members come from under-served communities in Delhi NCR. That is, thousands of passionate minds coming into a space that welcomes all, thousands of individuals claiming spaces that they have been denied. It has redefined reading by making its readers the locus of importance.I introduced the project’s curriculum in my classroom and saw gradual changes in my students’ learning process. My students become more attuned to their social-emotional self through our daily read-alouds, and they performed better in academic subjects. The daily read-aloud helped them wonder aloud and ask questions stemming from deep listening, curiosity and reflection. They learned to be more empathetic with their fellow classmates and themselves.Our new school library not only brought forward readers but also storytellers, writers and dreamers. Physical books were not the only way to tell or read a story. Children were writing and discussing their favourite bits of a story. They volunteered to do read-alouds for their peers, and ask questions to invite their audience into the experience. Students learned to read on their own and to take their beloved books home. They felt valued in the library.During one of our read-alouds, we read Rinchin’s Pyari Madam. It is an epistolary book that talks about several key issues like displacement, exploitation, and community through the eyes of a child. Following a rich conversation around the book, my students began writing letters to me in which they talked about their lives, struggles, and achievements. One of them spoke about how she felt in the classroom, around her peers. Writing that letter and thinking about the book gave her a language to express her social-emotional self. This was the true power of a good read-aloud which invited thinking. As a teacher, it helped me understand my students better. The letters I received that year taught me, too, the relationship between the reader and the text — something I was learning anew by observing my students’ engagement with their texts.This March, when the lockdown was announced and schools closed, educators and parents were instantly worried about their children’s academic learning. WhatsApp groups, Zoom classes and Google Classroom became sought after to facilitate the child’s education. In this chaos, access to the library and its literature was lost. Some private schools in Delhi went on to incorporate sports period in their online classes while rendering libraries disposable.My fourth graders found themselves without their library. They missed going to a space where they had the power to choose. The power to hold a book and not feel like an outsider. Again, I turned to TCLP. Soon after the closure of schools and libraries, TCLP redefined what it means to be a library in a pandemic. Librarians and volunteers at TCLP started recording low data audio and video read-alouds for thousands of its members and educators. They started asking themselves how to serve their readers, even the ones without Internet or smartphones. My students started receiving a new read-aloud twice a day, on each of three days a week.Just like TCLP, there are several free community libraries active in different parts of the country, libraries that are thinking of their readers when schools are forgetting about them. Schools need to see children not as cogs in the wheel of a traditional formal education. They are dynamic individuals with imagination, questions, and curiosity. To make libraries redundant is to extinguish readers. It also reduces reading to an exclusive “hobby”, accessible only to those who can pay.It brings us to a question: what does it mean to be a free library? It certainly means freedom from the ghost of membership and late fees. It is also freedom from age-old ideas of reading and discipline. A library could mean anything, and its meaning should be defined by its readers. And its seven-year-old members should certainly be able to go back to the library with the copy of Laut Ke Buddhu Ghar Ko Aye past its due date, and issue another book without any fear.amitanowal4@gmail.com \\n',\n",

Describing Mr. Yediyurappa as the architect of “Operation Kamala”, he said the BJP came to power only through such an immoral method. Speaking on the motion, Congress leader and KPCC president D.K.

He wondered why the Chief Minister was yet to take a delegation of MPs, let alone an all-party delegation, to the Centre to seek assistance for handling floods and COVID-19.Countering this, Mr. Yediyurappa wondered if it was possible for the BJP to win 25 of the total 28 Lok Sabha seats in the State if the people were not with it. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe 90s kids would remember collecting cassettes. It was a rigorous process. We shared cassettes, caught up with music videos playing on television, followed up with physical stores, and ensured that the music reflected our taste before investing money. It was a serious process that cost us a serious share of our pocket money and time. It reflected our personality and helped us make new friends and build stronger bonds with the old ones. We also painfully recorded songs, making mix albums and gifting those to our heartthrobs. Remember how we also showed off our collections to our friends and family? Those were the times.The cassettes made way for the CDs and the DVDs. Nothing changed much then except for the scale, cost, and storage format. You could save more songs now. You could also rewrite some of the DVDs. Sharing and collecting became easier. We had DVDs dedicated to genres of music or artists. As you like, please! The recording and the gifting of DVDs did not stop. We got worried if there were any scratches on the surface of the CDs. It broke our hearts every time a CD started malfunctioning. We used soap-water and what not to keep them all clean and running!The pen drives and the hard drives are still part of our lives now. In their heyday, you would find teenagers collecting songs, videos, and films (especially the naughty ones) on pen drives and hard drives without a care for the computer viruses that had also made way into our lives silently. The collection would be neatly organised into artists and genres. Friends borrowed these storage devices to keep a copy of a copy of a copy. All pirated. Indians could not care less for copyright. The world had exploded.Now, you do not have to collect. You do not even need to store and hoard. There is no need to share. Artificial Intelligence does the vetting and organising for you. It even suggests the music you would like. If you want to share some music with an old friend of yours or the world, you just need to share the link or the QR code on Spotify. You can listen to artists around the world alone or with your entire tribe, no matter where in the world they are situated. The switching costs have never been so low. As a teenager, I had these specific genres I listened to, specific artists. I knew where the artists were travelling to or what their next album would be. Now I don’t have to. I wonder if it is because I am in my 30s or if this phenomenon is ubiquitous.Do you remember how there would be that special friend who had the best collection of music and was given responsibility for having a never-ending collection ready for the picnic? Or how we used to praise that one friend in our group who had the most neatly organised exhaustive collection of music and videos? Those friends and people are not required any more. Their skills have become redundant now akin to how the skills of factory workers and even programmers become redundant sometimes. Alexa and Siri have replaced all of them. The organiser, the collector and the hoarder are dead.“Alexa! Play a sad song.”amartyadey88@gmail.com \\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe Madras High Court is mulling over the possibility of ordering a fresh preliminary inquiry by an “independent agency” into allegations of largescale irregularities by Municipal Administration and Rural Development Minister S.P. Velumani in award of several civil work contracts to private firms by the Greater Chennai and Coimbatore municipal corporations. Justices M.M. Sundresh and R. Hemalatha said they might order a fresh probe by an independent agency if they were not satisfied with the preliminary inquiry conducted by the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption (DVAC), which had filed an elaborate report, running to hundreds of pages, finding no material to proceed against the Minister. The judges asked advocates V. Suresh and E. Raj Thilak, representing the complainants Jayaram Venkatesan of NGO Arappor Iyakkam and DMK MP R.S. Bharathi respectively, to make their submissions on the possibility of transferring the same complaints, which they had lodged with the DVAC in 2018, to the “independent agency” for a fresh preliminary probe. The Bench also asked the lawyers to enlighten the court on Monday as to whether the independent agency should also be made as one of the respondents in the present batch of cases pending before the court. Direction sought The complainants wanted a direction to the DVAC to register a First Information Report (FIR) against the Minister and then conduct a full-fledged investigation. Their advocates told the court that if it was dissatisfied with the DVAC’s preliminary inquiry report, the best course would be to order registration of FIR and then transfer the case to an independent agency, such as the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). However, the judges differed and said they may instead order another preliminary inquiry by an independent agency. Dealing with the issue earlier, another Bench led by Justice M. Sathyanarayanan had appointed Superintendent of Police R. Ponni of the DVAC to conduct the preliminary inquiry. Accordingly, the officer conducted a detailed probe and filed a report to DVAC Director Vijay Kumar on December 18, 2019, stating that no case had been made out for registration of FIR. The inquiry report was approved by the Director and forwarded to the Vigilance Commissioner on January 13 this year. The Vigilance Commissioner, too, endorsed the report on January 18 and moved it to the government, which accepted the report on January 22 and dropped all further proceedings on the complaints lodged against the Minister. \\n',\n",

       " '\\n“The colonial building at Khasa village’s train station will be brought down soon to make way for a modern structure. It’s the same station where several Bollywood movies have been shot, including Salman Khan’s Bharat, and is the last train station before the final India-Pakistan border station of Attari…” So read a recent news report, which just broke my heart. After all, I shared no ordinary bond with this little station since childhood, which always remained painted in red and light yellow, not to forget its oval roof, which gave it the most vintage touch.With love for trains always running high, I was its regular visitor — not just when a train had to pass but also during other times. Thanks to my elders, especially an uncle who always brought me here. If I ever cried for some reason, everyone knew where to take me.During almost every visit, I would be introduced to the stationmaster in his office where I never forgot to scan every nook. The fan held by a long pipe from the high ceiling remains in my memory. Its noise still rings in my ears, and so goes for his signal clearance calls, when trains had to arrive.Taking cognisance of my curiosity, he often led us to the adjoining building, where train signals were upped or downed, and where tracks were made to merge or de-merge through large gears. It was the nerve centre of the station. But the best visits were when I was handed over to the engine driver to show me its inner world, making me always bid adieu to my uncle — as if I was set to go along. Thankfully, I listened to him and came out, the moment the train had to pull out. How could I forget that inside I always froze!As our village is located just minutes away from Amritsar city, we usually travelled by our car but for my excitement, my uncle often took me to the city on train. During every ride, I felt to be the luckiest child in the world and I wished the train which threaded through the rich green fields never stopped.The tale does not just end here, as even at home when I heard the train coming, I would climb the rooftop to catch its glimpse and kept myself glued there, till it remained stationed. Nearly three decades may have passed; those views still run clearly in my eyes. At the station too, we frequently climbed its bridge to catch sight of the trains.No wonder, I also drew the same station in many of my drawings at school with the loud presence of me, my uncle and of course, the stationmaster. I wish I had those drawings with me today but I do have many pictures, which I clicked during my many visits to the village from the city where I now live. My uncle and his family still live in the same village house near the station and during every visit, station talks come naturally to us.I kept my connection with it as I kept arriving by train from the city and returning in the evening, the latest trip being just a week before the lockdown.Now whenever the station building is put to the hammer, I will surely feel the pain, wherever I may be. It may disappear very soon but it can never disappear from my heart, the picture of which I am set to place by my bedside.rameshinder.sandhu@gmail.com \\n',\n",

       " '\\nCOVID-19 has resulted in the delayed reporting of cardiac problems, said K.P. Suresh Kumar, chief cardiologist, Kauvery Hospital, here on Saturday. Addressing a discussion through virtual conference on cardiac emergencies organised as part of The Hindu Wellness Series in association with Kauvery Hospital, he said owing to the fear of contracting SARS-CoV-2 infection, many people with symptoms related to cardiac problems decide to postpone or avoid visiting hospitals. Stressing on the need for immediate medical attention, ideally within two hours, in case of a heart attack, Dr. Suresh said any delay could result in irreversible damage to the heart and severely reduce the chances of saving life.Pointing out that many people misinterpret a heart attack as ordinary pain in the chest, he said a thumb rule could be to get medical attention if the pain one experiences is very different from any experienced before. He highlighted the need to not ignore some atypical symptoms of cardiovascular problems like unexplained fatigue and exertional breathlessness. C. Sundar, senior consultant cardiologist, Kauvery Hospital, highlighted how changes in lifestyle and food habits had increased the risk of cardiovascular disease. He said 28.1% of deaths were attributed to the ailment.While only 3.5% of the young population screened had hypertension in 1990, it was 14.5% in 2017. Regular exercise and balanced dietary habits were crucial in preventing cardiovascular disease.Giridhar Gyani, director general, Association of Healthcare Providers (India), spoke on how non-communicable diseases had become the major disease burden for India. He said around 63% of India’s disease burden were non-communicable diseases, of which cardiovascular disease was the majority. Arguing that preventive measures were better than curative measures, Dr. Gyani said the Ayushman Bharat Scheme of the Union Government focused on some of these preventive measures. “The scheme is not just about insurance. The setting up of 1.5 lakh health and wellness centres across the country will play an important role in addressing the non-communicable disease burden,” he said. Stating that COVID-19 had helped in taking stock of health infrastructure, he expressed hope that it would help in strengthening it.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThe Sahakara Sarige (Transport Cooperative Society) is all set to relaunch its transport services on October 26. Businessman M. Mahendra, a native of Hosanagar in Shivamogga district and currently settled in Bengaluru, has spoken to the executive body of the transport company that runs on a cooperative model.The 30-year-old organisation, with headquarters at Koppa, was offering its services on 76 routes, catering to the needs of over 30,000 people spread over Shivamogga, Udupi, and Chikkamagaluru districts. It stopped its services this February following increase in losses. Later, the representatives of the executive committee met representatives of the State government seeking funds. It also asked the government to reimburse the student pass dues. Around 300 employees have not got salaries for several months.E.S. Dharmappa, president of the society, told The Hindu the transport services will be restarted on a phased manner from October 26. “Mr. Mahendra, who travelled in our buses as a student in 2001-02, has come forward to revamp the organisation. He has agreed to provide funds for the immediate requirements so that we can start the services. As of now, we have not signed any agreements with him. Our concern is that employees get jobs and salaries and to help the public,” he said. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nViduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi founder Thol. Thirumavalavan on Saturday said that his party would continue to be with the DMK-led alliance, and he believed that there was no need for new parties in the front as it was already strong.Announcing that the VCK would protest against the farm Bills across Tamil Nadu on September 28, Mr. Thirumavalavan said the party was ready for the Assembly election and was determined to keep “reactionary forces” out of power in the State.“We are in the alliance led by the DMK and are very clear that casteist and religious forces should not gain prominence in Tamil Nadu, and power should not be in the hands of reactionary forces,” he said.Formidable alliance Contending that only the DMK-led alliance could keep the BJP at bay, he said that it was already a formidable alliance.“Only a DMK-led alliance can stop the BJP and Sanatana forces. There are already 10 parties in the alliance, and there is no need to add to it. There is enough strength,” he also said.Mr. Thirumavalavan added that the VCK would revert to contesting on an ‘independent symbol’.“Only in 2001, we contested on some other symbol. After that, we have been contesting on our own symbol. In the 2019 Lok Sabha election, we adopted a different strategy in Villupuram (where its candidate contested on the DMK symbol). In future, we will continue to contest on an independent symbol,” he said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nAbout a decade ago, I was part of an exercise group of women from villages near Christian Medical College Hospital, Vellore, who suffered from headache, tension, backache and general depression. The idea behind the weekly exercise programme started by the hospital’s low-cost effective care unit was to give the women time for physical exercise and a chance to meet others with similar difficulties, to share their stories and find strength and friendship. At first, the women were stiff and unsure of what their bodies could do. But, with encouragement, they worked hard at touching their toes, twisting their waists and doing some basic yoga asanas.For the first time, they realised that they had waists, hips and legs and that they could sway to music. They learnt to relax and reshape their bodies. The stiffness, aches and pains gave way to a lightness of being, joy at new friendships and an eagerness to experience new ideas.Sharing and caringApart from the exercises, we also had a time of sharing and caring. We heard about what had happened in each other’s lives the past week. Domestic violence and family relationships were the big issues. The women began to counsel each other and came up with ideas and solutions for many problems. We also shared the joys — the birth of a baby, a child who had passed the 10th standard exams, and weddings. We began celebrating birthdays — a string of jasmine and a box of sweets to take home was given to the birthday ladies as we sang “happy birthday”. As new friendships were born, old prejudices died; new understanding and fresh insights into relationships were gained. The group became a place for belonging, strength and refuge. I had just read My Grandfather’s Blessings by Rachel Remen. In her book, Dr. Remen describes how a volunteer bereavement group that made little red hearts for grieving children lifted a little child’s broken spirit. Red heartsI searched our little town for red velvet. I brought the material to our group and asked if they would like to make little hearts out of it to give away to those who were admitted in the wards alone and in pain. With great joy, we cut out little hearts. The women took them home to stuff and sew and brought them back the next week.They had made about 50 red hearts of all sizes. Then the women went to each ward and gave these little hearts away, explaining to each person they gave it to that they had made it specially for them so that they would know that someone was praying for them for healing. The patients were delighted. Many of them had had operations. The soft velvet hearts fitted so snugly into their palms. For many, it was the most beautiful thing they had ever held. A couple of women came over to see what it was all about. “Can I have one too,” one of them asked. I nodded, “Who is it for?” “It’s for a little boy who is in the bed next to my daughter,” she replied. “His mother can only come in the evenings, so I look after him.” I was touched by her compassion. The other woman said, “I’m going to give my heart away to whoever needs it.” That phrase has stayed with me ever since. I wonder who needs my heart today!ushajesudasan@gmail.com\\n',\n",
       " \"\\nThe story so far: Three Codes on labour law were passed by Parliament this week, amid strident criticism and vociferous protests by many trade unions. Hailed by industry as a much-needed reform and rationalisation of labour laws, the Codes on industrial relations, social security, occupational safety, health and working conditions amalgamate and replace several diverse laws on the subject. Last year, a separate Code on Wages was enacted. The Codes enacted now are modified versions of the Industrial Relations Code Bill introduced in 2019. Among these, the Industrial Relations Code is touted as one that would energise industry and spur economic activity, as it aims to free employees from the constraints of earlier labour laws.What are the main features of the Industrial Relations Code?The Industrial Relations Code combines the features of three erstwhile laws — the Trade Unions Act, 1926, the Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act, 1946, and the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. It defines ‘workers’ to include, besides all persons employed in a skilled or unskilled, manual, technical, operational and clerical capacity, supervisory staff drawing up to ₹18,000 a month as salary. It introduces ‘fixed term employment’, giving employers the flexibility to hire workers based on requirement through a written contract. Fixed term employees should be treated on a par with permanent workers in terms of hours of work, wages, allowances and other benefits, including statutory benefits such as gratuity.Editorial | Code debate: On new labour BillsThe Code says any establishment that employs 300 or more workers must prepare standing orders relating to classification of workers, manner of intimating to them periods and hours of work, holidays, pay days etc, shifts, attendance, conditions for leave, termination of employment, or suspension, besides the means available for redress of grievances. Earlier, the 2019 Bill applied this to units with 100 employees or more. The threshold has been raised to 300 in the 2020 Code. It confers on the ‘appropriate Government’, that is the Centre or the State governments, the power to exempt, with or without conditions, any industrial establishment or class of industrial establishments from all or any of the provisions of the Code, if it is satisfied that adequate provisions exist to fulfil its objectives.What does it say on trade unions?Where there is more than one trade union in an establishment, the sole negotiating union status will be given to the one that has 51% of the employees as its members. It has been brought down from the 75% requirement in the 2019 version. Where no union qualifies under this criterion, the employer must constitute a ‘negotiating council’ consisting of representatives drawn from the various unions, with only those with at least 20% of employees as its members.Also read | Labour codes passed are anti-worker, say trade unionsWhat are the provisions on lay-off and closure?The provisions that require the prior permission of the government for lay-off, retrenchment and closure are made applicable to only establishments that had employed 300 or more workers on an average per working day in the preceding 12 months. The Code also allows the government to raise this threshold by notification. A lay-off would be deemed illegal if it is effected without permission or is done despite refusal of permission, but it will not be so if the employee had been offered alternative employment that does not require any special skill or cause undue hardship. The Code prescribes notice period, or payment in lieu of notice period, and prior government permission before retrenchment of anyone who has been in continuous service for a year or more. Such a prior permission requirement is in place also for closure of a unit, with the application to be filed 90 days prior to the intended closure.The Hindu In Focus podcast | Will the new labour codes benefit India's workers?How does the new Code affect the right to strike?The Code prohibits strikes and lock-outs in all industrial establishments without notice. No unit shall go on strike in breach of contract without giving notice 60 days before the strike, or within 14 days of giving such a notice, or before the expiry of any date given in the notice for the strike. Further, there should be no strike during any conciliation proceedings, or within seven days of the conclusion of such proceedings; or during proceedings before an industrial tribunal or 60 days after their conclusion or during arbitration proceedings. Similar restrictions have been given on the employer from announcing a lock-out. The Industrial Disputes Act, 1947, had placed such restrictions on announcing strikes only in respect of public utility services. However, the present Code extends it to all establishments. Even the Standing Committee on Labour had favoured limiting these provisions to public utilities.\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nIt used to be a never-ending war of words between my friend’s young daughter and her grandmother, with the old lady trying to pass on her ideas of socio-cultural value-based living and the girl hating to be conditioned to follow the rules of the previous generation and believing in rewiring the social mores of her community.Conditioned upbringing that influences one’s mindset and thought process to operate in a guided pattern is generally not welcomed. Great thinkers and enlightened personalities have always stressed the need to break free of conditioned upbringing that tries to instil archaic and defunct values of the previous generations. Current and upcoming generations are being motivated to develop a discriminative intellect to look at the world through a wider lens, through perspectives based on independent, conscious and rational thinking.We, however, tend to miss the fact that at the most fundamental level, our rules of life are constructed on a set of moral and ethical indices. Life on earth is innocuously designed to follow certain common values of humaneness, behaviour, etiquette and integrated responses that conform to a conditioned pattern. This basic conditioning is the result of millions of years of striving to achieve a semblance of peace and harmony. This conditioned pattern is the criteria to strike a rapport with fellow beings and live in an integrated environment.While this can be called universal conditioning, lying unobtrusively at the substratum of survival, which no one can transgress, violate or transcend without destroying themselves in the process, then the question arises as to how and where are we supposed to transcend and break free of a conditioned pattern of living?A great thinker said, “There should neither be a compulsion to break the rules of the past nor a compulsion to follow them.” So it is to be decided by the individual and it is her prerogative; each one has to decide on the level, degree and extent of conditioned pattern of living that will suit a peaceful, organised life within the precincts of socio-cultural norms, and take care not to compromise on individualistic beliefs, ideals and principles.newshara@yahoo.com\\n',\n",
       " '\\nDMK Parliamentary party leader T.R. Baalu on Saturday said the argument of Agriculture Minister Duraikannu and Secretary Gagandeep Singh Bedi that the newly-enacted Farm Bills would benefit the farmers was unacceptable and against the interests of farmers.“The AIADMK government supported the bills in both Houses of Parliament to escape CBI raids. The AIADMK government has become panicky after the DMK and its alliance partners announced a State-wide demonstration,” he claimed in a statement.Mr. Baalu said at a time when farmers in the country were boiling over the likely consequences of the legislation, the Minister and the Secretary supporting it was highly condemnable.“The Minister from the Delta district and the Secretary were under compulsion to justify the legislation to save the Chief Minister post of Mr. Edappadi K. Palaniswami,” he said and added that it was regrettable.Minimum support price Mr. Baalu accused Mr. Bedi of expressing views in favour of corporate houses when he opined that there was a provision to levy 150% penalty on corporate houses if they reduced the minimum support price. “What is the need for the Secretary to give such an explanation? There is no reference to minimum support price in the legislation as mentioned by the Secretary,” he said.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nThis story can happen anywhere in the world, but it struck me as I was reading a local newspaper at the Houston airport waiting for my host to drive me to College Station. A report read, “40% of Texans are overweight or obese.” It was a mild shock, to say the least. I shared it with my host. He said, “You have been in the U.S. for nearly six months in two visits. Are you noticing it only today?” At College Station, my hostess, who practises internal medicine, took over the conversation. “Some of my patients are overweight and obese. Is there a specific yoga for weight reduction,” she asked. “Yes, it is known as mind control. Ask them to skip one meal,” I said. “That is not possible. For two dollars, they get a plateful and they do not want to waste food.” “So they decide to waste the food in their stomachs!”Back in Chennai, I started observing people who tip the scale beyond the recommended body mass index. My heart skips a beat whenever I sight anyone overweight or obese. If the person is younger, my heart skips two beats. When it became too frequent, I stopped taking it to heart. Simple mantraAll such people and parents of younger ones especially know the simple mantra, “Reduce intake and increase expenditure of energy.” Those who know this mantra, however, underestimate intake and overestimate expenditure. In an in-company training programme for middle-level managers in their forties who tend to put on weight, the simple method of working out the calorie intake and expenditure was explained by the company medical officer. The participants were also told to take the message to colleagues and family members.There was a move in U.K. restaurants to charge overweight and obese customers double for every dish. Soon there was a protest, and restaurant owners and the proponents of this move had to eat their words.Now to come to the meat of the story, obese and overweight persons are under two charges. One charge is levelled by their circulatory and skeletal systems. The heart is a zero-leak pump working non-stop throughout one’s life, something no pump designer has ever been able to design. For every extra kilogram more than the optimum weight, the heart struggles to pump blood. The joints from ankle upwards and the muscles have elastic limits beyond which they will moan, croak and crack. The second charge is on behalf of the undernourished or malnourished members of society. They have less food or nutrients available for them at affordable costs.Of the two charges, the first is more serious. The charges are to be heard in one’s own court in the brain. Now let the overweight and obese persons be their own judges. If charges are proved, they write their own sentence.lakshmibashyam@yahoo.com \\n',\n",
       " '\\nChief Secretary K. Shanmugam held a review meeting through video conferencing with 15 District Collectors to discuss COVID-19 prevention measures as their districts had shown a spike in the number of cases. Mr. Shanmugam discussed prevention measures with the Collectors of Salem, Chengalpattu, Tiruvallur, Cuddalore, Tiruppur, Kancheepuram, Thanjavur, Erode, Tiruvannamalai, Villupuram, Vellore, Namakkal, Dharmapuri, Tiruvarur and Coimbatore.An official release said the Chief Secretary discussed issues such as containing the spread of COVID-19, taking steps to reduce the fatality rate, identifying the symptoms swiftly and providing proper treatment.The Chief Secretary also said that the measures should be intensified in containment zones, and that the districts should be supervised by the District Collectors, monitoring the number of cases and the availability of beds and medicines since restrictions had been relaxed.The release recalled that Prime Minister Narendra Modi had recently praised Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palaniswami for the State’s response during the pandemic.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nNon-compliance with mask wearing and physical distancing norms continues to be a problem in several parts of the State. Public health officials, doctors and experts have been reiterating the need for adherence to precautionary measures to contain the transmission of COVID-19. However, going by the number of violations of COVID-19 norms and the amount of fines imposed, adherence remains poor in several districts. According to officials, around ₹1.8 crore has been collected as fine for more than 80,000 violations in the State till September 25 under the Tamil Nadu Public Health Act.As per the amended Act, a person can be fined for violating quarantine measures and physical distancing norms, not wearing masks and spitting in public places. However, many persons, including in Chennai, do not wear masks or continue to wear masks improperly in public places. Physical distancing norms too go for a toss in many places, including in shops and banks, and people continue to spit in public places.Chennai topped the table, with a fine amount of nearly ₹63 lakh collected so far, for around 31,000 offences. Apart from the city, the number of violations and fines collected was high in a number of districts. Thanjavur accounted for nearly 5,000 offences and around ₹11 lakh as fine. In Salem and Namakkal, the fine imposed was more than ₹9 lakh each. A little over ₹8.5 lakh was collected as fine in Tiruvarur, while in Tiruppur, around ₹8 lakh was collected for offences under the Act, according to official sources. There were several instances of violations in districts such as Dindigul, Erode, Krishnagiri, Theni and Tiruchi.A public health official said that many were still unaware of the benefits of wearing masks. “People should understand the importance of wearing masks and following physical distancing norms to arrest the spread of COVID-19. Masks provide protection, while regular handwashing and disinfection of places, including houses and hospitals, are important. People should avoid crowding and unnecessary travel,” he said.E. Theranirajan, dean of the Rajiv Gandhi Government General Hospital, said that many people continued to wear masks improperly. “As of now, there are three vaccines against COVID-19 — face masks, hand hygiene and physical distancing,” he said.Worrying areas The areas of concern, according to Prabhdeep Kaur, Scientist-E/Deputy Director, Indian Council of Medical Research-National Institute of Epidemiology, are public transport, restaurants operating in closed spaces, workplaces with 100% employee strength and malls functioning with full AC, which could lead to an increase in transmission in the coming days. She stressed the need for ensuring compliance with mask wearing and physical distancing norms. Restrictions on gatherings should be strictly implemented, she added.“When we look at the number of cases, it is slightly on the upward trend and we need to watch very carefully. We will get to know the real scenario in two to three weeks. Considering that the incubation period of the virus is 14 days, we will know the effect of opening up by the end of September,” she said. She noted that many restaurants were fully functioning, but no re-arrangement of seatings or spacing was done. “Although air conditioners should not be used, restaurants do carry a high risk of transmission as there is more mobility and utilisation. Indoor dining in restaurants is a cause of worry,” she said. She said that socialising at home too should be done with utmost care, as there are elderly members and persons with co-morbidities in families. “People should be mindful of the risks when meeting relatives and friends,” she said.\\n',\n",

The meeting was part of a series of consultations being held by the urban body with respect to the preparation of the Master Plan for Delhi (MPD) – 2041. Two more ‘Youth Sabhas’ are lined up for October 1 and 3.A senior DDA official said, “The objective of this consultation was to take the views of Delhi’s youth on what more could be provided to ensure quality education. The dialogue aimed to focus on the access to associated amenities like housing, connectivity to these institutions and so on.”According to the DDA, over 800 people had registered for the event and around 450 participated in it.Skill enhancement The official further said, “A need was felt for equitably distributed skill enhancement institutions that would help them [students] hone their employability skills and make them ready for the job market. The gap between jobseekers and actual available jobs is vast and some concrete steps need to be taken to bridge it.”The urban body also said that students residing on the Capital’s periphery complained of longer travelling time. “A youth from Najafgarh mentioned that the nearest college is 25 km away and it takes him one hour to traverse that distance one way. This is not only time consuming but also unsafe for young women as they do not always get to travel thro-ugh appropriate means of commute,” the official said.Several civil service aspirants residing in Mukherjee Nagar raised issues pertaining to their safety and unaffordable housing facilities for students in the area.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nA special drive to uproot the invasive lantana bushes in the famous Sajjangarh wildlife sanctuary in Rajasthan’s Udaipur district has helped in ecological restoration of grasslands and saved biodiversity. The month-and-a-half-long campaign was accompanied by the plantation of native species on the cleared patches of land.‘Mission lantana’ The small sanctuary in the southern Aravalli hills, spread over 5.19 sq. km, is home to a large number of herbivores. Lantana camara, a thicket forming shrub, has covered vast tracts of land in the sanctuary, stopping the natural light and nutrition for flora and fauna.The toxic substance in its foliage and ripe berries affected the animals, while its expansion stopped the natural growth of grass and other shrubs. With the herbivores not getting sufficient forage, the prey base for carnivorous animals was declining, leading to ecological disturbances in the food chain.The “mission lantana” was taken up last month at the instance of a senior woman police officer who noticed an unease among the herds of spotted deer with the gradual shrinking of their natural habitat. Inspector General of Police Binita Thakur discussed the matter with wildlife experts and initiated action to get rid of lantana bushes, which had taken over almost 50% of the sanctuary.The drive involved collective efforts and ‘shram daan’ (voluntary physical work) by the forest officials, police personnel, wildlife lovers, representatives of voluntary groups and local villagers. The volunteers used hand gloves and an equipment, monkey jack, for removing the toxic flowery shrubs.After 45 days, about 10 hectares of land has been cleared. The Forest Department, which has planted over 500 saplings in the cleared pockets, plans to take up sowing of grass and a variety of alternate plant seeds as the vegetation useful for herbivores.Udaipur-based environmentalist Satish Sharma told The Hindu that the drive should be taken up in the rainy season for the next three to four years to make a permanent impact. “The correct ecological approach would be the removal from top to bottom in hilly areas and centre to periphery in the plains.”Tourism & Wildlife Society of India’s honorary secretary Harsh Vardhan said lantana, first introduced in 1807, had spread to wildlife reserves, river banks and the Project Tiger areas where it had obliterated native grass and reduced biodiversity. In some regions, the plant has made inroads into pastures and shrunk the cattle grazing areas, affecting the livelihood of villagers. Natural grass has started growing in the Sajjangarh sanctuary and the spotted deer and other herbivores can be seen foraging on the vegetation. \\n',\n",
       " '\\nTourism and rural development, which is the theme of this year’s World Tourism Day being celebrated on Sunday, will be the focus of the Rajasthan government’s new tourism policy during the COVID-19 pandemic. The policy has a vision for utilising the tourism sector’s ability to support economic development of rural areas.The theme set by the U.N. World Tourism Organisation would complement the State government’ efforts to create innovative tourism products and generate new opportunities in the rural areas, Alok Gupta, Principal Secretary (Tourism), said here on Saturday. The focus would be on lesser-known tourist destinations, he said.As the tourism sector has been worst hit by the pandemic, the policy seeks to promote new investments for development of more tourist venues. “In addition to strengthening infrastructure and improving connectivity, the policy has laid emphasis on safety and security of tourists,” Mr. Gupta said.Promoting local craft and cuisine has also been made part of the new policy, as the sector is set to be promoted as a means to improving rural economy. The State government has already declared reimbursement of the State’s share in GST to hotels and restaurants, made renewal of bar licences easier and relaxed motor vehicle tax for vehicles of more than 22-person capacity.\\n',\n",
       " '\\nIt was Ladakh’s peak winter month of February in 1983. Near Khardungla at 5,600-metre altitude, the temperature was minus-40 degrees Celsius, not counting wind chill. That’s when I first saw Thangavelu, clearing snow with a bulldozer on the icy road so that Army vehicles could move.He climbed down stiffly from his open bulldozer, removed his snow goggles and lifted his balaclava cap. His face was crusted with his frozen condensed breath, his facial muscles immobilised by extreme cold after hours of difficult and risky work clearing snow at high altitude.It was only later, when I met him in more congenial surroundings minus heavy extreme climate clothing, that I noticed how he had aged prematurely, because he looked around 60, though aged 45.Thangavelu had been a Sapper, an Army Corps of Engineers soldier, retired at age 34 after 15 years of “colour service”, with a paltry pension and no job. (It is hardly different today 37 years later). He was fortunate to get employment in the General Reserve Engineer Force (GREF) of the Border Roads Organisation (BRO) as a bulldozer operator to construct and maintain roads in inhospitable mountainous regions.I met Thangavelu, or rather I should say I had the privilege of meeting him, only because I happened to assume command of the task force in which he was already posted. On my asking, he proudly told me that he had educated his two children, one of them as a medical doctor. Here was a simple soldier from the deep south of India, cheerfully operating a bulldozer in Ladakh in peak winter in hazardous conditions for a pittance, in the service of the nation.GREF personnel work in areas varying from the rainy snake- and leech-infested jungles in the mountains of the northeastern States to the bitterly cold deserts of Ladakh. They undergo severe physical hardship and risk from rock falls and avalanches, and accident or sickness in inhospitable conditions, with long periods of separation from family.Duty firstThe GREF soldier’s dedication to duty matches that of the Army jawan, and Thangavelu was both. Every jawan or GREF soldier who performs his duty, and often dies in the line of duty, cannot be given awards that are reserved for exceptional acts of courage or service, but this does not in any manner reduce the value of their personal sacrifices made in the service of our country.If we look around, we may notice thousands of “Thangavelus”. They are not only jawans or GREF soldiers but also farmers, factory workers, workers in civic services and many other vocations in the villages and towns all over the country. It is the Thangavelus, the “common man” and “common woman”, who sustain our country with their hard work, often facing personal risk, always undergoing hardship, courageously facing adversity.When we feel low under the burden of our difficulties and self-inflicted problems, let us spare a thought for the common man and woman of India who toils daily, who has multiple problems far more severe than ours but still works cheerfully, so that we may live our privileged lives. Let us salute the common man and woman, the essence of our India.sg9kere@live.com\\n',\n",
